physics/,"354 Let 0 be the angle made by the string with the vertical. When the bob is at the mean position, 9 = 0 There are only two forces acting on the bob; the tension T along the string and the vertical force due to gravity (=mg). The force mg can be resolved into the component mg cost) along the string and mg sine perpendicular to it. Since the motion of the bob is along a circle of length L and centre at the support point, the bob has a radial acceleration (wZL) and also a tangental acceleration; the latter arises since motion along the arc of the circle is not uniform. The radial acceleration is provided by the net radial force T —mg cosG, while the tangential acceleration is provided by mg sine. It is more convenient to work with torque about the support since the radial force gives zero torque. Torque 1' about the support is entirely provided by the tangental component of force 1 = —L (mg sine) (14.22) This is the restoring torque that tends to reduce angular displacement — hence the negative sign. By Newton’s law of rotational motion, 1' = ICC (14.23) where I is the moment of inertia of the system about the support and 0L is the angular acceleration. Thus, I a: —mg sin 0 L (14.24) Or, mgL a = — sin6 (14.25) We can simplify Eq. (14.25) if we assume that the displacement 9 is small. We know that sin 9 can be expressed as, sing: 0—£+i+m (14.26) 3! 5! _ where 6 is in radians. Now if 0 is small, sin 9 can be approximated by 0 and Eq. (14.25) can then be written as, mgL ‘1 = —T‘9 (14.27) In Table 14.1, we have listed the angle 9 in degrees, its equivalent in radians, and the value 2019-20 PHYSICS Sl-IM - how small should the amplitude be? When you perform the experiment to determine the time period of a simple pendulum, your teacher tells you to keep the amplitude small. But have you ever asked how small is small? Should the amplitude to 5°, 2°, 1°. Or 05°? Or could it be 10°. 20°, or 30°? To appreciate this. It would be better to measure the time period for different amplitudes, up to large amplitudes. Of course, for large oscillations, you will have to take care that the pendulum oscillates in a vertical plane. Let us denote the time period for small-amplitude oscillations as T(0) and write the time period for amplitude 00 as ’1190) = cT(0). Where cis the multiplying factor. If you plot a graph of c versus 00. You will get values somewhat like this: 20° 45° 50° 700 90° 1.02 1.04 1.05 1.10 1.18 This means that the error in the time period is about 2% at an amplitude of 20°. 5% at an amplitude of 50°. And 10% at an amplitude of 70° and 18% at an amplitude of 90°. In the experiment. You will never be able to measure T(0) because this means there are no oscillations. Even theoretically, sin 0 is exactly equal to 0 only for 6 = 0. There will be some inaccuracy for all other values of 0 . The difference increases with increasing 9 . Therefore we have to decide how much error we can tolerate. No measurement is ever perfectly accurate. You must also consider questions like these: What is the accuracy of the stopwatch? What is your own accuracy in starting and stopping the stopwatch? You will realise that the accuracy in your measurements at this level is never better than 5% or 10%. Since the above table shows that the time period of the pendulum increases hardly by 5% at an amplitude of 50° over its low amplitude value. You could very well keep the amplitude to be 50° in your experiments."
physics/,"LAWS OF MOTION 95 dP F _ k— t (5.2) For a body of fixed mass m, d_P : 1(mv) : md_"" : ma (5.3) dt dt dt i.e the Second Law can also be written as F = k ma (5.4) which shows that force is proportional to the product of mass m and acceleration a. The unit of force has not been defined so far. In fact, we use Eq. (5.4) to deﬁne the unit of force. We, therefore, have the liberty to choose any constant value for k. For simplicity, we choose k = 1. The second law then is dp_ F: E — ma (5.5) In SI unit force is one that causes an acceleration of 1 m s2 to a mass of 1 kg. This unit is known as newton: 1 N = 1 kgm s2. Let us note at this stage some important points about the second law : 1. In the second law, F = 0 implies a = O. The second law is obviously consistent with the first law. 2. The second law of motion is a vector law. It is equivalent to three equations, one for each component of the vectors : dp FX 2 dtx = max dpy Fy = — 2 may dt dp Fz= dtz=m a2 (5.6) This means that if a force is not parallel to the velocity of the body, but makes some angle with it, it changes only the component of velocity along the direction of force. The component of velocity normal to the force remains unchanged. For example, in the motion of a projectile under the vertical gravitational force, the horizontal component of velocity remains unchanged (Fig. 5.5). 3. The second law of motion given by Eq. (5.5) is applicable to a single point particle. The force F in the law stands for the net external force on the particle and a stands for acceleration of the particle. It turns out, however, that the law in the same form applies to a rigid body or, even more generally, to a system of particles. In that case, F refers to the total external force on the system and a refers to the acceleration of the system as a whole. More precisely, a is the acceleration of the centre of mass of the system about which we shall study in detail in chapter 7. Any internal forces in the system are not to be included in F. Fig. 5.5 Acceleration at an instant is detem1ined by the force at that instant. The moment after a stone is dropped out of an accelerated train, it has no horizontal acceleration or force, if air resistance is neglected. The stone carries no memory of its acceleration with the train a moment ago. 4. The second law of motion is a local relation which means that force F at a point in space (location of the particle) at a certain instant of time is related to a at that point at that instant. Acceleration here and now is determined by the force here and now, not by any history of the motion of the particle (See Fig. 5.5). > Example 5.2 A bullet of mass 0.04 kg moving with a speed of 90 m s'1 enters a heavy wooden block and is stopped after a distance of 60 cm.

It starts with the cash or bank balances at the beginning of the period. Generally, it is made on monthly basis. This is a very popular book and is maintained by all organisations, big or small, profit or not-for- profit. It serves the purpose of both journal as well as the ledger (cash) account. It is also called the book of original entry. When a cashbook is maintained, transactions of cash are not recorded in the journal, and no separate account for cash or bank is required in the ledger. 4.1.1 Single Column Cash Back The single column cash book records all cash transactions of the business in a chronological order, i.e., it is a complete record of cash receipts and cash payments.

biology/,"316 BIOLOGY 21. 1 NEURAL SYSTEM The neural system of all animals is composed of highly specialised cells called neurons which can detect, receive and transmit different kinds of stimuli. The neural organisation is very simple in lower invertebrates. For example, in Hydra it is composed of a network of neurons. The neural system is better organised in insects, where a brain is present along with a number of ganglia and neural tissues. The vertebrates have a more developed neural system. 21.2 HUMAN NEURAL SYSTEM The human neural system is divided into two parts : (i) the central neural system (CNS) (ii) the peripheral neural system (PNS) The CNS includes the brain and the spinal cord and is the site of information processing and control. The PNS comprises of all the nerves of the body associated with the CNS (brain and spinal cord). The nerve ﬁbres of the PNS are of two types : (a) afferent fibres (b) efferent ﬁbres The afferent nerve ﬁbres transmit impulses from tissues / organs to the CNS and the efferent ﬁbres transmit regulatory impulses from the CNS to the concerned peripheral tissues / organs. The PNS is divided into two divisions called somatic neural system and autonomic neural system. The somatic neural system relays impulses from the CNS to skeletal muscles while the autonomic neural system transmits impulses from the CNS to the involuntary organs and smooth muscles of the body. The autonomic neural system is further classiﬁed into sympathetic neural system and parasympathetic neural system. Visceral nervous system is the part of the peripheral nervous system that comprises the whole complex of nerves, ﬁbres, ganglia, and plexuses by which impulses travel from the central nervous system to the viscera and from the viscera to the central nervous system. 21.3 NEURON As STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL UNIT 0F NEURAL SYSTEM A neuron is a microscopic structure composed of three major parts, namely, cell body, dendrites and axon (Figure 2 1. 1).

accounts/,"Trial Balance and Rectification of Errors 191 case of two errors compensating each other’s effect. One plus is set off by the other minus, the net effect of these two errors is nil and so they do not affect the agreement of trial balance. 6.5 Searching of Errors If the trial balance does not tally, it is a clear indication that at least one error has occured. The error (or errors) needs to be located and corrected before preparing the ﬁnancial statements. If the trial balance does not tally, the accountant should take the following steps to detect and locate the errors : Recast the totals of debit and credit columns of the trial balance. Compare the account head / title and amount appearing in the trial balance, with that of the ledger to detect any difference in amount or omission of an account. Compare the trial balance of current year with that of the previous year to check additions and deletions of any accounts and also verify whether there is a large difference in amount, which is neither expected nor explained. Re-do and check the correctness of balances of individual accounts in the ledger. Re-check the correctness of the posting in accounts from the books of original entry. If the difference between the debit and credit columns is divisible by 2, there is a possibility that an amount equal to one-half of the difference may have been posted to the wrong side of another ledger account. For example, if the total of the debit column of the trial balance exceeds by ? 1,500, it is quite possible that a credit item of ?750 may have been wrongly posted in the ledger as a debit item. To locate such errors, the accountant should scan all the debit entries of an amount of ? 750. The difference may also indicate a complete omission of a posting. For example, the difference of ? 1,500 given above may be due to omissions of a posting of that amount on the credit side. Thus, the accountant should verify all the credit items with an amount of ? 1,500. If the difference is a multiple of 9 or divisible by 9, the mistake could be due to transposition of figures. For example, if a debit amount of ? 459 is posted as ? 954, the debit total in the trial balance will exceed the credit side by ? 495 (i.e. 954 — 459 = 495). This difference is divisible by 9. A mistake due to wrong placement of the decimal point may also be checked by this method. Thus, a difference in trial balance divisible by 9 helps in checking the errors for a transposed mistake. 2019-2020"
biology/,"BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 18.1 .3.2 Rh grouping Another antigen, the Rh antigen similar to one present in Rhesus monkeys (hence Rh), is also observed on the surface of RBCs of majority (nearly 80 per cent) of humans. Such individuals are called Rh positive (Rh+ve) and those in whom this antigen is absent are called Rh negative mh-ve). An Rh-ve person, if exposed to Rh+ve blood, will form speciﬁc antibodies against the Rh antigens. Therefore, Rh group should also be matched before transfusions. A special case of Rh incompatibility (mismatching) has been observed between the Rh-ve blood of a pregnant mother with Rh+ve blood of the foetus. Rh antigens of the foetus do not get exposed to the Rh-ve blood of the mother in the ﬁrst pregnancy as the two bloods are well separated by the placenta. However, during the delivery of the ﬁrst child, there is a possibility of exposure of the maternal blood to small amounts of the Rh+ve blood from the foetus. In such cases, the mother starts preparing antibodies against Rh antigen in her blood. In case of her subsequent pregnancies, the Rh antibodies from the mother (Rh-ve) can leak into the blood of the foetus (Rh+ve) and destroy the foetal RBCs. This could be fatal to the foetus or could cause severe anaemia and jaundice to the baby. This condition is called erythroblastosis foetalis. This can be avoided by administering anti-Rh antibodies to the mother immediately after the delivery of the ﬁrst child. 18. 1.4 Coagulation of Blood You know that when you cut your ﬁnger or hurt yourself, your wound does not continue to bleed for a long time; usually the blood stops ﬂowing after sometime. Do you know why? Blood exhibits coagulation or clotting in response to an injury or trauma. This is a mechanism to prevent excessive loss of blood from the body. You would have observed a dark reddish brown scum formed at the site of a cut or an injury over a period of time. It is a clot or coagulam formed mainly of a network of threads called ﬁbrins in which dead and damaged formed elements of blood are trapped. Fibrins are formed by the conversion of inactive ﬁbrinogens in the plasma by the enzyme thrombin. Thrombins, in turn are formed from another inactive substance present in the plasma called prothrombin. An enzyme complex, thrombokinase, is required for the above reaction. This complex is formed by a series of linked enzymic reactions (cascade process) involving a number of factors present in the plasma in an inactive state. An injury or a trauma stimulates the platelets in the blood to release certain factors which activate the mechanism of coagulation. Certain factors released by the tissues at the site of injury also can initiate coagulation. Calcium ions play a very important role in clotting."

The detailed description of their form and appearance only brought out their diversity. It is the cell theory that emphasised the unity underlying this diversity of fonns, i.e., the cellular organisation of all life forms. A description of cell structure and cell growth by division is given in the chapters comprising this unit. Cell theory also created a sense of mystery around living phenomena, i.e., physiological and behavioural processes. This mystery was the requirement of integrity of cellular organisation for living phenomena to be demonstrated or observed. In studying and understanding the physiological and behavioural processes, one can take a physico-chemical approach and use cell-free systems to investigate. This approach enables us to describe the various processes in molecular terms. The approach is established by analysis of living tissues for elements and compounds. It will tell us what types of organic compounds are present in living organisms. In the next stage, one can ask the question: What are these compounds doing inside a cell? And, in what way they carry out gross physiological processes like digestion, excretion, memory, defense, recognition, etc. In other words we answer the question, what is the molecular basis of all physiological processes? It can also explain the abnormal processes that occur during any diseased condition. This physico-chemical approach to study and understand living organisms is called ‘Reductionist Biology’. The concepts and techniques of physics and chemistry are applied to understand biology. In Chapter 9 of this unit, a brief description of biomolecules is provided. 2019-2020"

The porous cellophane membrance of the tube allows the passage of molecules based on concentration gradient. As nitrogenous wastes are absent in the dialysing ﬂuid, these substances freely move out, thereby clearing the blood. The cleared blood is pumped back to the body through a vein after adding anti-heparin to it. This method is a boon for thousands of uremic patients all over the world. Kidney transplantation is the ultimate method in the correction of acute renal failures (kidney failure).

(d) Show Pluto - A Dwarf Planet The International Astronomical Union (IAU) at the IAU 2006 General Assembly held on August 24, 2006, in Prague in Czech Republic, adopted a new deﬁnition of planets in our Solar System. According to the new deﬁnition, Pluto is no longer a planet. This means that the Solar System consists of eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. According to the IAU usage, the ‘planet’ and ‘other bodies’ in our Solar System, except satellites, are to be deﬁned into three distinct categories of celestial objects in the following way: 1. A ‘planet’ is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit. 2. A ‘dwarf planet’ is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, (c) has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit, and (d) is not a satellite. 3. All ‘other objects’, except satellites, orbiting the Sun, shall be referred to collectively as ‘Small Solar-System Bodies’. Unlike other eight planets in the Solar System, Pluto’s orbital path overlaps with ‘other objects’ and the planet Neptune. The ‘other objects’ currently include most of the Solar System asteroids, most of the Trans—Neptum’an Objects (TNOs), comets, and other small bodies. Pluto is a ‘dwarf planet’ by the above definition and is recognised as the prototype of a new category of Trans-Neptunian Objects. 2019-20"
biology/,"216 BIOLOGY Scientists also tried to know whether all plants have PGA as the ﬁrst product of CO2 ﬁxation, or whether any other product was formed in other plants. Experiments conducted over a wide range of plants led to the discovery of another group of plants, where the ﬁrst stable product of CO2 ﬁxation was again an organic acid, but one which had 4 carbon atoms in it. This acid was identiﬁed to be oxaloacetic acid or 0AA. Since then CO2 assimilation during photosynthesis was said to be of two main types: those plants in which the ﬁrst product of CO2 ﬁxation is a C3 acid (PGA), i.e., the C3 pathway, and those in which the ﬁrst product was a C 4 acid (0AA), i.e., the C 4 pathway. These two groups of plants showed other associated characteristics that we will discuss later. 13.7. 1 The Primary Acceptor of CO2 Let us now ask ourselves a question that was asked by the scientists who were struggling to understand the ‘dark reaction’. How many carbon atoms would a molecule have which after accepting (fixing) C02, would have 3 carbons (of PGA)? The studies very unexpectedly showed that the acceptor molecule was a 5-carbon ketose sugar — ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). Did any of you think of this possibility? Do not worry; the scientists also took a long time and conducted many experiments to reach this conclusion. They also believed that since the ﬁrst product was a C3 acid, the primary acceptor would be a 2-carbon compound; they spent many years trying to identify a 2-carbon compound before they discovered the 5-carbon RuBP. 13.7.2 The Calvin Cycle Calvin and his co-workers then worked out the whole pathway and showed that the pathway operated in a cyclic manner; the RuBP was regenerated. Let us now see how the Calvin pathway operates and where the sugar is synthesised. Let us at the outset understand very clearly that the Calvin pathway occurs in all photosynthetic plants; it does not matter whether they have C3 or C 4 (or any other) pathways Wigure 13.8). For ease of understanding, the Calvin cycle can be described under three stages: carboxylation, reduction and regeneration. l . Carboxylation — Carboxylation is the ﬁxation of CO2 into a stable organic intermediate. Carboxylation is the most crucial step of the Calvin cycle where CO2 is utilised for the carboxylation of RuBP. This reaction is catalysed by the enzyme RuBP carboxylase which results in the formation of two molecules of 3-PGA. Since this enzyme also has an oxygenation activity it would be more correct to call it RuBP carboxylase-oxygenase or RuBisCO."
physics/,"SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTA'l‘lONAL MOTION 149 problems without explicitly outlining and justifying the procedure. We now realise that in earlier studies we assumed, without saying so, that rotational motion and/ or internal motion of the particles were either absent or negligible. We no longer need to do this. We have not only found the justification of the procedure we followed earlier; but we also have found how to describe and separate the translational motion of (1) a rigid body which may be rotating as well, or (2) a system of particles with all kinds of internal motion. Parabolic path of the projectile Explosion \ Path of the CM \ g \of fragments Fig. 7.12 The centre of mass of the fragments of the projectile continues along the same parabolic path which it would have followed if there were no explosion. Figure 7 .12 is a good illustration of Eq. (7 . 1 1). A projectile, following the usual parabolic trajectory, explodes into fragments midway in air. The forces leading to the explosion are internal forces. They contribute nothing to the motion of the centre of mass. The total external force, namely, the force of gravity acting on the body, is the same before and after the explosion. The centre of mass under the inﬂuence of the external force continues, therefore, along the same parabolic trajectory as it would have followed if there were no explosion. 7.4 LINEAR MOMENTUM OF A SYSTEM OF PARTICLES Let us recall that the linear momentum of a particle is defined as p = m v (7 . 12) Let us also recall that Newton’s second law written in symbolic form for a single particle is dp F:— dt (7.13) where F is the force on the particle. Let us consider a system of n particles with masses m1, Tl respectively. The particles may be interacting and have external forces acting on them.

All bryophytes represent this pattern. The diploid sporophyte is represented by a dominant, independent, photosynthetic, vascular plant body. It alternates with multicellular, saprophytic/autotrophic, independent but short-lived haploid gametophyte. Such a pattern is known as haplo-diplontic life cycle. All pteridophytes exhibit this pattern (Figure 3.7 c). Interestingly, while most algal genera are haplontic, some of them such as Ectocarpus, Polysiphonia, kelps are haplo-diplontic. Fucus, an alga is diplontic. SUMMARY Plant kingdom includes algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms.

Coordination is the process through which two or more organs interact and complement the functions of one another. For example, when we do physical exercises, the energy demand is increased for maintaining an increased muscular activity. The supply of oxygen is also increased. The increased supply of oxygen necessitates an increase in the rate of respiration, heart beat and increased blood ﬂow via blood vessels. When physical exercise is stopped, the activities of nerves, lungs, heart and kidney gradually return to their normal conditions. Thus, the functions of muscles, lungs, heart, blood vessels, kidney and other organs are coordinated while performing physical exercises. In our body the neural system and the endocrine system jointly coordinate and integrate all the activities of the organs so that they function in a synchronised fashion. The neural system provides an organised network of point-to-point connections for a quick coordination. The endocrine system provides chemical integration through hormones. In this chapter, you will learn about the neural system of human, mechanisms of neural coordination like transmission of nerve impulse, impulse conduction across a synapse and the physiology of reﬂex action. 2019-2020"

(5.5) F = ma = mg Thus the given equation describes the motion of a particle under acceleration due to gravity and y is the position coordinate in the direction of g. 4 Impulse We sometimes encounter examples where a large force acts for a very short duration producing a finite change in momentum of the body. For example, when a ball hits a wall and bounces back, the force on the ball by the wall acts for a very short time when the two are in contact, yet the force is large enough to reverse the momentum of the ball. Often, in these situations, the force and the time duration are difficult to ascertain separately. However, the product of force and time, which is the change in momentum of the body remains a measurable quantity. This product is called impulse: Impulse = Force X time duration = Change in momentum (5.7) A large force acting for a short time to produce a finite change in momentum is called an impulsive force. In the history of science, impulsive forces were put in a conceptually different category from 2019-20 ordinary forces. Newtonian mechanics has no such distinction. Impulsive force is like any other force — except that it is large and acts for a short time. > Example 5.4 A batsman hits back a ball straight in the direction of the bowler without changing its initial speed of 12 m S’l. If the mass of the ball is O. 15 kg, determine the impulse imparted to the ball. (Assume linear motion of the ball) Answer Change in momentum = 0.15 X 12—(—0.15X12) = 3.6Ns, Impulse = 3.6 N s, in the direction from the batsman to the bowler. This is an example where the force on the ball by the batsman and the time of contact of the ball and the bat are difficult to know, but the impulse is readily calculated. 4 5.6 NEWTON’S THIRD LAW OF MOTION The second law relates the external force on a body to its acceleration. What is the origin of the external force on the body ? What agency provides the external force ? The simple answer in Newtonian mechanics is that the external force on a body always arises due to some other body. Consider a pair of bodies A and B. B gives rise to an external force on A. A natural question is: Does A in turn give rise to an external force on B ? In some examples, the answer seems clear. If you press a coiled spring, the spring is compressed by the force of your hand. The compressed spring in turn exerts a force on your hand and you can feel it. But what if the bodies are not in contact ? The earth pulls a stone downwards due to gravity. Does the stone exert a force on the earth ? The answer is not obvious since we hardly see the effect of the stone on the earth. The answer according to Newton is: Yes, the stone does exert an equal and opposite force on the earth. We do not notice it since the earth is very massive and the effect of a small force on its motion is negligible. Thus, according to Newtonian mechanics, force never occurs singly in nature. Force is the mutual interaction between two bodies. Forces"

Certain 10. 11. 12. physical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities [such as length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity]. Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly standardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole and candela). The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called fundamental or base units. Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a combination of the base units and are called derived units. A complete set of units, both fundamental and derived, is called a system of units. The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present internationally accepted unit system and is Widely used throughout the world. The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and the derived quantities obtained from them. Certain derived units are expressed by means of SI units with special names [such as joule, newton, watt, etc). The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols [such as m for metre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.). Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific notation, with powers of 10. Scientific notation and the prefixes are used to simplify measurement notation and numerical computation, giving indication to the precision of the numbers. Certain general rules and guidelines must be followed for using notations for physical quantities and standard symbols for SI units, some other units and SI prefixes for expressing properly the physical quantities and measurements. In computing any physical quantity, the units for derived quantities involved in the relationship(s) are treated as though they were algebraic quantities till the desired units are obtained. Direct and indirect methods can be used for the measurement of physical quantities. In measured quantities, while expressing the result, the accuracy and precision of measuring instruments along with errors in measurements should be taken into account. In measured and computed quantities proper significant figures only should be retained. Rules for determining the number of significant figures, carrying out arithmetic operations with them, and ‘rounding off ‘ the uncertain digits must be followed. The dimensions of base quantities and combination of these dimensions describe the nature of physical quantities. Dimensional analysis can be used to check the dimensional consistency of equations, deducing relations among the physical quantities, etc. A dimensionally consistent equation need not be actually an exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong or inconsistent equation must be wrong. 2019-20"

physics/,"PHYSICS The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that ‘two systems in thermal equilibrium with a third system separately are in thermal equilibrium with each other”. The Zeroth Law leads to the concept of temperature. Internal energy of a system is the sum of kinetic energies and potential energies of the molecular constituents of the system. It does not include the over—all kinetic energy of the system. Heat and work are two modes of energy transfer to the system. Heat is the energy transfer arising due to temperature difference between the system and the surroundings. Work is energy transfer brought. about. by other means. such as moving the piston of a cylinder containing the gas. by raising or lowering some weight. connected to it. The first. law of thermodynamics is the general law of conservation of energy applied to any system in which energy transfer from or to the surroundings (through heat and work) is taken into account. It states that AQ =AU+ AW where AQ is the heat supplied to the system. AWis the work done by the system and AU is the change in internal energy of the system."

This movement of electrons is downhill, in terms of an oxidation-reduction or redox potential scale. The electrons are not used up as they pass through the electron transport chain, but are passed on to the pigments of photosystem PS I. Simultaneously, electrons in the reaction centre of PS I are also excited when they receive red light of wavelength 700 nm and are transferred to another accepter molecule that has a greater redox potential. These electrons then are moved downhill again, this time to a molecule of energy-rich NADP’“. The addition of these electrons reduces NADP+ to NADPH + H“. This whole scheme of transfer of electrons, starting from the PS 11, uphill to the acceptor, down the electron transport chain to PS I, excitation of electrons, transfer to another acceptor, and ﬁnally down hill to NADP+ reducing it to NADPH + H+ is called the Z scheme, due to its characterstic shape (Figure 13.5). This shape is formed when all the carriers are placed in a sequence on a redox potential scale. 13.6. 1 Splitting of Water You would then ask, How does PS II supply electrons continuously? The electrons that were moved from photosystem 11 must be replaced. This is achieved by electrons available due to splitting of water. The splitting of water is associated with the PS 11; water is split into 2H“, [0] and electrons. This creates oxygen, one of the net products of photosynthesis. The electrons needed to replace those removed from photosystem I are provided by photosystem II. We need to emphasise here that the water splitting complex is associated with the PS 11, which itself is physically located on the inner side of the membrane of the thylakoid. Then, where are the protons and 02 formed likely to be released — in the lumen? or on the outer side of the membrane? 13.6.2 Cyclic and Non-cyclic Photo-phosphorylation Living organisms have the capability of extracting energy from oxidisable substances and store this in the form ofbond energy.

Cartilage is present in the tip of nose, outer ear joints, between adjacent bones of the vertebral column, limbs and hands in adults. Bones have a hard and non-pliable ground substance rich in calcium salts and collagen ﬁbres which give bone its strength Wigure 7 .6b). It is the main tissue that provides structural frame to the body. Bones support and protect softer tissues and organs. The bone cells (osteocytes) are present in the spaces called lacunae. Limb bones, such as the long bones of the legs, serve weight-bearing functions. They also interact with skeletal muscles attached to them to bring about movements. The bone marrow in some bones is the site of production of blood cells. Blood is a ﬂuid connective tissue containing plasma, red blood cells REC), white blood cells (WBC) and platelets (Figure 7.60). It is the main circulating ﬂuid that helps in the transport of various substances.

These ﬁbres are composed of numerous ﬁne ﬁbrils, called myofibrils. Muscle ﬁbres contract (shorten) in response to stimulation, then relax (lengthen) and return to their uncontracted state in a coordinated fashion. Their action moves the body to adjust to the changes in the environment and to maintain the positions of the various parts of the body. In general, muscles play an active role in all the movements of the body. Muscles are of three types, skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. Skeletal muscle tissue is closely attached to skeletal bones. In a typical muscle such as the biceps, striated (striped) skeletal muscle ﬁbres are bundled together in a parallel fashion (Figure 7 .7 a). A sheath of tough connective tissue encloses several bundles of muscle ﬁbres (You will learn more about this in Chapter 20)."

Nearly 99 per cent reabsorption of the ﬁltrate takes place through different parts of the nephrons. PCT is the major site of reabsorption and selective secretion. HL primarily helps to maintain osmolar gradient (300 mOsmolL‘1 - 1200 mOsmolL‘l) within the kidney interstitium.

A counter current mechanism operates between the two limbs of the loop of Henle and those of vasa recta (capillary parallel to Henle’s loop). The ﬁltrate gets concentrated as it moves down the descending limb but is diluted by the ascending limb. Electrolytes and urea are retained in the interstitium by this arrangement.

This is called the escape speed, sometimes loosely called the escape velocity. Equation (8.32) applies equally well to an object thrown from the surface of the moon with g replaced by the acceleration due to Moon’s gravity on its surface and rE replaced by the radius of the moon. Both are smaller than their values on earth and the escape speed for the moon turns out to be 2.3 km/s, about five times smaller. This is the reason that moon has no atmosphere. Gas molecules if formed on the surface of the moon having velocities larger than this will escape the gravitational pull of the moon. } Example 8.4 Two uniform solid spheres of equal radii R, but mass M and 4 M have a centre to centre separation 6 R, as shown in Fig. 8.10.

(15.53) and the approximate relation Eq. (15.51 ) are the same. 15.8.3 Both Source and Observer Moving We will now derive a general expression for Doppler shift when both the source and the observer are moving. As before, let us take the direction from the observer to the source as the positive direction. Let the source and the observer be moving with velocities us and v0 respectively as shown in Fig. 15.18. Suppose at time t = O, the observer is at O1 and the source is at SI, 01 being to the left of SI. The source emits a wave of velocity v, of frequency v and period TO all measured by an observer at rest with respect to the medium. Let L be the distance between 01 and S1 at t= 0, when the source emits the first crest. Now, since the observer is moving, the velocity of the wave relative to the observer is v+ vo. Therefore, the first crest reaches the observer at time t1 = L/ (U + v0). At time t = To, both the observer and the source have moved to their new positions 02 and 82 respectively. The new distance between the observer and the source, 02 82, would be L+(vS—v0) To]. At 82, the source emits a second crest. 2019-20 Fig. 1 5. 1 8 Doppler effect when both the source and observer are moving with different velocities. Application of Doppler effect The change in frequency caused by a moving object due to Doppler effect is used to measure their velocities in diverse areas such as military. medical science. astrophysics. etc. It is also used by police to check over—speeding of vehicles. A sound wave or electromagnetic wave of known frequency is sent towards a moving object. Some part of the wave is reﬂected from the object and its frequency is detected by the monitoring station. This change in frequency is called Doppler shift. It is used at airports to guide aircraft. and in the military to detect enemy aircraft. Astrophysicists use it to measure the velocities of stars. Doctors use it to study heart beats and blood ﬂow in different parts of the body. Here they use ulltrasonic waves, and in common practice. it is called sonography. Ultrasonic waves enter the body of the person. some of them are reﬂected back. and give information about motion of blood and pulsation of heart valves, as well as pulsation of the heart of the foetus. In the case of heart. the picture generated is called echocardiogram.

Permanent tissues having all cells similar in structure and function are called simple tissues. Permanent tissues having many different types of cells are called complex tissues. 6. 1 .2. 1 Simple Tissues A simple tissue is made of only one type of cells. The various simple tissues in plants are parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma (Figure 6.2). Parenchyma forms the major component within organs. The cells of the parenchyma are generally isodiametric. They may be spherical, oval, round, polygonal or elongated in shape. Their walls are thin and made up of cellulose. They may either be closely packed or have small intercellular spaces. The parenchyma performs various functions like photosynthesis, storage, secretion. The collenchyma occurs in layers below the epidermis in most of the dicotyledonous plants. It is found either as a homogeneous layer or in patches. It consists of cells which are much thickened at the corners due to a deposition of cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. Collenchymatous cells may be oval, spherical or polygonal and often contain chloroplasts. These cells assimilate food when they contain chloroplasts. Intercellular spaces are absent. They provide mechanical support to the growing parts of the plant such as young stem and petiole of a leaf. Sclerenchyma consists of long, narrow cells with thick and lignified cell walls having a few or numerous pits. They are usually dead and without protoplasts. On the basis of variation in form, structure, origin and development, sclerenchyma may be either fibres or sclereids.

The stem is the ascending part of the axis bearing branches, leaves, ﬂowers and fruits. It develops from the plumule of the embryo of a germinating seed. The stem bears nodes and internodes. The region of the stem where leaves are born are called nodes while internodes are the portions between two nodes. The stem bears buds, which may be terminal or axillary. Stem is generally green when young and later often become woody and dark brown. The main function of the stem is spreading out branches bearing leaves, ﬂowers and fruits. It conducts water, minerals and photosynthates. Some stems perform the function of storage of food, support, protection and of vegetative propagation. 5.2.1 Modiﬁcations of Stem The stem may not always be typically like what they are expected to be. They are modiﬁed to perform different functions (Figure 5.6). Underground stems of potato, ginger, turmeric, zaminkand, Colocasia are modiﬁed to store food in them. They also act as organs of perennation to tide over conditions unfavourable for growth. Stem tendrils which develop from axillary buds, are slender and spirally coiled and help plants to climb such as in gourds (cucumber, pumpkins, watermelon) and grapevines. Axillary buds of stems may also get modiﬁed into woody, straight and pointed thorns. Thorns are found in many plants such as Citrus, Bougainvillea. They protect plants from browsing animals. Some plants of arid regions modify their stems into ﬂattened (Opuntia), or ﬂeshy cylindrical (Euphorbia) structures. They contain chlorophyll and carry"

Nucleus Nuclear pore Rough endoplasmic reticulum 8.5.3.1 The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Electron microscopic studies of eukaryotic cells reveal the presence of a network or reticulum of tiny tubular structures scattered in the cytoplasm that is called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure 8.5). Hence, ER divides the intracellular space into two distinct compartments, i.e., luminal (inside ER) and extra luminal (cytoplasm) compartments. The ER often shows ribosomes attached to their outer surface. The endoplasmic reticulun bearing ribosomes on their surface is called rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). In the absence of . Endoplasmic ribosomes they appear smooth and are called reticulum smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER)- Figure 8.5 Endoplasmic reticulum RER is frequently observed in the cells actively involved in protein synthesis and secretion. They are extensive and continuous with the outer membrane of the nucleus. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the major site for synthesis of lipid.

Each translational and rotational degree of freedom corresponds to one energy mode of absorption and has energy 1/2 k3 T. Each vibrational frequency has two modes of energy (kinetic and potential) with corresponding energy equal to 2 X 1/2 kBT= kBT. Using the law of equipartition of energy, the molar specific heats of gases can be determined and the values are in agreement with the experimental values of specific heats of several gases. The agreement can be improved by including vibrational modes of motion. The mean free path lis the average distance covered by a molecule between two successive collisions : l x/Enﬂ'd2 where n is the number density and d the diameter of the molecule. 1: POINTS TO PONDER 1. Pressure of a ﬂuid is not only exerted on the wall. Pressure exists everywhere in a ﬂuid. Any layer of gas inside the volume of a container is in equilibrium because the pressure is the same on both sides of the layer. We should not have an exaggerated idea of the intermolecular distance in a gas. At ordinary pressures and temperatures, this is only 10 times or so the interatomic distance in solids and liquids. What is different is the mean free path which in a gas is 100 times the interatomic distance and 1000 times the size of the molecule. The law of equipartition of energy is stated thus: the energl for each degree of freedom in thermal equilibrium is 1/2 kB T. Each quadratic term in the total energl expression of a molecule is to be counted as a degree of freedom. Thus, each vibrational mode gives 2 (not 1) degrees of freedom (kinetic and potential energl modes), corresponding to the energ] 2 X 1/2 kB T= kB T. Molecules of air in a room do not all fall and settle on the ground (due to gravity) because of their high speeds and incessant collisions. In equilibrium, there is a very slight increase in density at lower heights (like in the atmosphere). The effect is small since the potential energl (mgh) for ordinary heights is much less than the average kinetic energl 1A mu2 of the molecules. < v2 > is not always equal to ( < v >)2.

Then, the argument of the sine function in Equation (1 5.2) is constant -03t. The displacement y, at a fixed location, thus, varies sinusoidally with time. That is, the constituents of the medium at different positions execute simple harmonic motion. Finally, as tincreases, xmust increase in the positive direction to keep kx— cot + q) constant. Thus, Eq. (15.2) represents a sinusiodal (harmonic) wave travelling along the positive direction of the x—axis. On the other hand, a function y(x,t)=asin(kx+u)t+¢) (15.4) represents a wave travelling in the negative direction of x-axis.

(15.2) Fig. 15.6 shows the plots of Eq. (15.2) for different values of time differing by equal intervals of time. In a wave, the crest is the point of maximum positive displacement, the trough is the point of maximum negative displacement. To see how a wave travels, we can fix attention on a crest and see how it progresses with time. In the figure, this is shown by a cross (X) on the crest. In the same manner, we can see the motion of a particular constituent of the medium at a fixed location, say at the origin of the x—axis. This is shown by a solid dot (0). The plots of Fig. 15.6 show that with time, the solid dot (0) at the origin moves periodically, i.e., the particle at the origin oscillates about its mean position as the wave progresses. This is true for any other location also. We also see that during the time the solid dot (0) has completed one full oscillation, the crest has moved further by a certain distance. (6) Fig. 15.6 A harmonic wave progressing along the positive direction of x—axis at different times. Using the plots of Fig. 15.6, we now define the various quantities of Eq. (15.2). 15.3.1 Amplitude and Phase In Eq. (15.2), since the sine function varies between 1 and —1, the displacement y (x, t) varies between a and —a. We can take a to be a positive constant, without any loss of generality. Then, a represents the maximum displacement of the constituents of the medium from their equilibrium position. Note that the displacement y may be positive or negative, but a is positive. It is called the amplitude of the wave. The quantity (kx — wt + (p) appearing as the argument of the sine function in Eq. (15.2) is called the phase of the wave. Given the amplitude a, the phase determines the displacement of the wave at any position and at any instant. Clearly q) is the phase at x = O and t = 0. Hence, ¢ is called the initial phase angle. By suitable choice of origin on the x—axis and the intial time, it is possible to have (1) = 0. Thus there is no loss of generality in dropping q), i.e., in taking Eq. (15.2) with q) = 0. 2019-20"

physics/,"376 PHYSICS are much more difficult to compress than gases and so have much higher values of bulk modulus. Now, see Eq. (15.19). Solids and liquids have higher mass densities { p ) than gases. But the corresponding increase in both the modulus (B) of solids and liquids is much higher. This is the reason why the sound waves travel faster in solids and liquids. We can estimate the speed of sound in a gas in the ideal gas approximation. For an ideal gas, the pressure P, volume Vand temperature T are related by (see Chapter 1 1). PV= NkBT (15.21) where N is the number of molecules in volume V, k3 is the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature of the gas (in Kelvin). Therefore, for an isothermal change it follows from Eq.(15.2 1) that VAP + PAV = 0 AP or _ = AV/ V P Hence, substituting in Eq. (15.16), we have B = P Therefore, from Eq. (15.19) the speed of a longitudinal wave in an ideal gas is given by, v = E (15.22) p This relation was ﬁrst given by Newton and is known as Newton’s formula. Example 1 5.4 Estimate the speed of sound in air at standard temperature and pressure. The mass of 1 mole of air is 29.0 X10‘3k. Answer We know that 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 litres at STP. Therefore, density of air at STP is: p0 = (mass of one mole of air)/ (volume of one mole of air at STP) _ 29.0x10‘3 kg 22.4x10‘3 m3 = 1.29 kg m—3 According to Newton’s formula for the speed of sound in a medium, we get for the speed of sound in air at STP, 1.01x105Nm'2 1.29 kgm“3 1/2 ] =280mS'1 (15.23) 4 2019-20 The result shown in Eq.(15.23) is about 15% smaller as compared to the experimental value of 331 m S'1 as given in Table 15.1. Where did we go wrong ? If we examine the basic assumption made by Newton that the pressure variations in a medium during propagation of sound are isothermal, we find that this is not correct. It was pointed out by Laplace that the pressure variations in the propagation of sound waves are so fast that there is little time for the heat ﬂow to maintain constant temperature. These variations, therefore, are adiabatic and not isothermal. For adiabatic processes the ideal gas satisfies the relation (see Section 12.8), PV” = constant i.e. A(PV7) = O or PyVV‘1 AV+ VYAP= o where y is the ratio of two specific heats, Cp/Cv. Thus, for an ideal gas the adiabatic bulk modulus is given by, B = _ AP “‘1 AV/V = IYp The speed of sound is, therefore, from Eq. (15.19), givenby, v = (ﬂ (1524) p This modiﬁcation of Newton’s formula is referred to as the Laplace correction. For air 7: 7/5. Now using Eq.

It turns out that wave pulses continue to retain their identities after they have crossed. However, during the time they overlap, the wave pattern is different from either of the pulses. Figure 15.9 shows the situation when two pulses of equal and opposite shapes move towards each other. When the pulses overlap, the resultant displacement is the algebraic sum of the displacement due to each pulse. This is known as the principle of superposition of waves."

These smaller DNA are called (about 0.1 “ml plasmids. The plasmid DNA confers certain unique phenotypic characters to such bacteria. One such character is resistance to antibiotics.

No organelles, like the ones in eukaryotic cell with other eukaryotes, are found in prokaryotic cells except organisms for ribosomes. Prokaryotes have something unique in the form of inclusions. A specialised differentiated form of cell membrane called mesosome is the characteristic of prokaryotes. They are essentially infoldings of cell membrane. 8.4. 1 Cell Envelope and its Modiﬁcations Most prokaryotic cells, particularly the bacterial cells, have a chemically complex cell envelope. The cell envelope consists of a tightly bound three layered structure i.e., the outermost glycocalyx followed by the cell wall and then the plasma membrane. Although each layer of the envelope performs distinct function, they act together as a single protective unit. Bacteria can be classiﬁed into two groups on the basis of the differences in the cell envelopes and the manner in which they respond to the staining procedure developed by Gram viz. those that take up the gram stain are Gram positive and the others that do not are called Gram negative bacteria. Glycocalyx differs in composition and thickness among different bacteria. It could be a loose sheath called the slime layer in some, while in others it may be thick and tough, called the capsule. The cell wall determines the shape of the cell and provides a strong structural support to prevent the bacterium from bursting or collapsing. The plasma membrane is selectively permeable in nature and interacts with the outside world. This membrane is similar structurally to that of the eukaryotes. A special membranous structure is the mesosome which is formed by the extensions of plasma membrane into the cell. ’Ihese extensions are in the form of vesicles, tubules and lamellae.

Assembly of a protein from amino acids requires energy input. On the other hand, catabolic pathways lead to the release of energy. For example, when glucose is degraded to lactic acid in our skeletal muscle, energy is liberated. This metabolic pathway from glucose to lactic acid which occurs in 10 metabolic steps is called glycolysis. Living organisms have learnt to trap this energy liberated during degradation and store it in the form of chemical bonds. As and when needed, this bond energy is utilised for biosynthetic, osmotic and mechanical work that we perform. The most important form of energy currency in living systems is the bond energi in a chemical called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). How do living organisms derive their energy? What strategies have they evolved? How do they store this energy and in what form? How do they convert this energy into work? You will study and understand all this under a sub-discipline called ‘Bioenergetics’ later in your higher classes. 9. 1 1 THE LIVING STATE At this level, you must understand that the tens and thousands of chemical compounds in a living organism, otherwise called metabolites, or biomolecules, are present at concentrations characteristic of each of them. For example, the blood concentration of glucose in a normal healthy individual is 4.2 mmol/L—6. 1 mmol/ L, while that of hormones would be nanograms/mL. The most important fact of biological systems is that all living organisms exist in a steady-state characterised by concentrations of each of these biomolecules. These biomolecules are in a metabolic ﬂux. Any chemical or physical process moves spontaneously to equilibrium. The steady state is a non-equilibrium state. One should remember from physics that systems at equilibrium cannot perform work. As living organisms work continuously, they cannot afford to reach equilibrium. Hence the living state is a non-equilibrium steady- state to be able to perform work; living process is a constant effort to prevent falling into equilibrium. This is achieved by energy input. Metabolism provides a mechanism for the production of energy. Hence the living state and metabolism are synonymous. Without metabolism there cannot be a living state. 153"

geography/,"4 gradually, it got organised. As a social science discipline, geography studies the ‘spatial organisation’ and ‘spatial integration’. Geography as a discipline is concerned with three sets of questions: (i) Some questions are related to the identiﬁcation of the patterns of natural and cultural features as found over the surface of the earth. These are the questions about what? (ii) Some questions are related to the distribution of the natural and human / cultural features over the surface of the earth. These are the questions about where? Taken together, both these questions take care of distributional and locational aspects of the natural and cultural features. These questions provided inventorised information of what features and where located. It was a very popular approach during the colonial period. These two questions did not make geography a scientiﬁc discipline till the third question was added. (iii) The third question is related to the explanation or the causal relationships between features and the processes and phenomena. This aspect of geography is related to the question, why? Geography as a discipline is related to space and takes note of spatial characteristics and attributes. It studies the patterns of distribution, location and concentration of phenomena over space and interprets them providing explanations for these patterns. It takes note of the associations and inter- relationships between the phenomena over space and interprets them providing explanations for these patterns. It also takes note of the associations and inter-relationships between the phenomena resulting from the dynamic interaction between human beings and their physical environment. GEOGRAPHY As AN INTEGRATING DISCIPLINE Geography is a discipline of synthesis. It attempts spatial synthesis, and history attempts temporal synthesis. Its approach is holistic in nature. It recognises the fact that the world is a system of interdependencies. FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY The present world is being perceived as a global village. The distances have been reduced by better means of transportation increasing accessibility. The audio-visual media and information technology have enriched the data base. Technology has provided better chances of monitoring natural phenomena as well as the economic and social parameters. Geography as an integrating discipline has interface with numerous natural and social sciences. All the sciences, whether natural or social, have one basic objective, of understanding the reality. Geography attempts to comprehend the associations of phenomena as related in sections of reality. Figure 1.1 shows the relationship of geography with other sciences. Every discipline, concerned with scientific knowledge is linked with geography as many of their elements vary over space. Geography helps in understanding the reality in totality in its spatial perspective. Geography, thus, not only takes note of the differences in the phenomena from place to place but integrates them holistically which may be different at other places. A geographer is required to have a broad understanding of all the related fields, to be able to logically integrate them. This integration can be understood with some examples. Geography inﬂuences historical events. Spatial distance itself has been a very potent factor to alter the course of history of the world. Spatial depth provided defence to many countries, particularly in the last century. In traditional warfare, countries with large size in area, gain time at the cost of space. The defence provided by oceanic expanse around the countries of the new world has protected them from wars being imposed on their soil. If we look at the historical events world over, each one of them can be interpreted geographically. In India, Himalayas have acted as great barriers and provided protection but the passes provided routes to the migrants and invaders from Central Asia. The sea coast has encouraged contact with people from East and Southeast Asia, Europe and Africa. Navigation technology helped European countries to colonise a number of countries of Asia and Africa, including India as they got accessibility 2019-2020"

Animals and plants exhibit a wide range of movements. Streaming of protoplasm in the unicellular organisms like Amoeba is a simple form of movement. Movement of cilia, ﬂagella and tentacles are shown by many organisms. Human beings can move limbs, jaws, eyelids, tongue, etc. Some of the movements result in a change of place or location. Such voluntary movements are called locomotion. Walking, running, climbing, ﬂying, swimming are all some forms of locomotory movements. Locomotory structures need not be different from those affecting other types of movements. For example, in Paramoecium, cilia helps in the movement of food through cytopharynx and in locomotion as well. Hydra can use its tentacles for capturing its prey and also use them for locomotion. We use limbs for changes in body postures and locomotion as well. The above observations suggest that movements and locomotion cannot be studied separately. The two may be linked by stating that all locomotions are movements but all movements are not locomotions. Methods of locomotion performed by animals vary with their habitats and the demand of the situation. However, locomotion is generally for search of food, shelter, mate, suitable breeding grounds, favourable climatic conditions or to escape from enemies / predators. 20. l TYPES OF MOVEMENT Cells of the human body exhibit three main types of movements, namely, amoeboid, ciliary and muscular. 2019-2020"

Flagellated protozoans: The members of this group are either free-living or parasitic. They have ﬂagella. The parasitic forms cause diaseases such as sleeping sickness. Example: Trypanosoma. Ciliated protozoans: These are aquatic, actively moving organisms because of the presence of thousands of cilia. They have a cavity (gullet) that opens to the outside of the cell surface. The coordinated movement of rows of cilia causes the water laden with food to be steered into the gullet. Example: Paramoecium (Figure 2.4b). Sporozoans: This includes diverse organisms that have an infectious spore-like stage in their life cycle. The most notorious is Plasmodium (malarial parasite) which causes malaria, a disease which has a staggering effect on human population. 2.3 KINGDOM FUNGI The fungi constitute a unique kingdom of heterotrophic organisms. They show a great diversity in morphology and habitat. You must have seen fungi on a moist bread and rotten fruits. The common mushroom you eat and toadstools are also fungi. White spots seen on mustard leaves are due to a parasitic fungus. Some unicellular fungi, e. g., yeast are used to make bread and beer. Other fungi cause diseases in plants and animals; wheat rust-causing Puccinia is an important example. Some are the source of antibiotics, e. g., Penicillium. Fungi are cosmopolitan and occur in air, water, soil and on animals and plants. They prefer to grow in warm and humid places. Have you ever wondered why we keep food in the refrigerator ‘? Yes, it is to prevent food from going bad due to bacterial or fungal infections. With the exception of yeasts which are unicellular, fungi are ﬁlamentous. Their bodies consist of long, slender thread-like structures called hyphae. The network of hyphae is known as mycelium. Some hyphae are continuous tubes ﬁlled with multinucleated cytoplasm — these are called coenocytic hyphae. Others have septae or cross walls in their hyphae. The cell walls of fungi are composed of chitin and polysaccharides. Most fungi are heterotrophic and absorb soluble organic matter from dead substrates and hence are called saprophytes. Those that depend on living plants and animals are called parasites. They can also live as symbionts — in association with algae as lichens and with roots of higher plants as mycorrhiza. Reproduction in fungi can take place by vegetative means — fragmentation, ﬁssion and budding. Asexual reproduction is by spores"
accounts/,"192 Accountancy 6.6 Rectiﬁcation of Errors From the point of view of rectiﬁcation, the errors may be classiﬁed into the following two categories: (a) errors which do not affect the trial balance. (b) errors which affect the trial balance. This distinction is relevant because the errors which do not affect the trial balance usually take place in two accounts in such a manner that it can be easily rectified through a journal entry whereas the errors which affect the trial balance usually affect one account and a journal entry is not possible for rectiﬁcation unless a suspense account has been opened. Such errors are rectiﬁed by passing a nullifying entry in the respective account as explained before under 6.6.2. 6.6.1 Rectification of Errors which do not Affect the Trial Balance These errors are committed in two or more accounts. Such errors are also known as two sided errors. They can be rectified by recording a j ournal entry giving the correct debit and credit to the concerned accounts. Examples of such errors are — complete omission to record an entry in the books of original entry; wrong recording of transactions in the book of accounts; complete omission of posting to the wrong account on the correct side, and errors of principle. The rectiﬁcation process essentially involves: ° Cancelling the effect of wrong debit or credit by reversing it; and 0 Restoring the effect of correct debit or credit. For this purpose, we need to analyse the error in terms of its effect on the accounts involved which may be: (i) Short debit or credit in an account; and / or (ii) Excess debit or credit in an account. Therefore, rectification entry can be done by: (i) debiting the account with short debit or with excess credit, (ii) crediting the account with excess debit or with short credit. The procedure for rectiﬁcation for such errors is explained with the help of following examples: (a) Credit sales to Mohan ? 10,000 were not recorded in the sales book. This is an error of complete omission. Its affect is that Mohan’s account has not been debited and Sales account has not been credited. Accordingly, recording usual entry for credit sales will rectify the error. 2019-2020"

Exchange of gases also occur between blood and tissues. 02 and CO2 are exchanged in these sites by simple diffusion mainly based on pressure / concentration gradient. Solubility of the gases as well as the thickness of the membranes involved in diffusion are also some important factors that can affect the rate of diffusion. Pressure contributed by an individual gas in a mixture of gases is called partial pressure and is represented as p02 for oxygen and pCO2 for carbon dioxide. Partial pressures of these two gases in the atmospheric air and the two sites of diffusion are given in Table 1 7.1 and in Figure 1 7.3.

biology/,"40 BIOLOGY 3.5 ANGIOSPERMS Unlike the gymnosperms where the ovules are naked, in the angiosperms or ﬂowering plants, the pollen grains and ovules are developed in specialised structures called ﬂowers. In angiosperms, the seeds are enclosed in fruits. The angiosperms are an exceptionally large group of plants occurring in wide range of habitats. They range in size from the smallest Wolﬂ‘ia to tall trees of Eucalyptus (over 100 metres). They provide us with food, fodder, fuel, medicines and several other commercially important products. They are divided into two classes : the dicotyledons and the monocotyledons (Figure 3.5). The dicotyledons are characterised by seeds having two cotyledons, reticulate venations in leaves, and tetramerous or pentamerous ﬂowers, i.e., having four or five members in each ﬂoral whorls. The monocotyledons on the other hand are characterised by single cotyledonous seeds, parallel venation in leaves, and trimerous ﬂowers having three members in each ﬂoral whorls. The male sex organ in a ﬂower is the stamen. Each stamen consists of a slender ﬁlament with an anther at the tip. Within the anthers, the pollen mother cell divide by meiosis to produce microspores which matures into pollen grains. The female sex organ in a ﬂower is the pistil. Pistil consists of a swollen ovary at its base, a long slender style and stigma. Inside the ovary, ovules are present. Generally each ovule has a megaspore mother cell that undergoes meiosis to form four haploid megaspores. Three of them degenerate and one divide to form the embryo sac. Each embryo-sac has a three-celled egg apparatus — one egg cell and two synergids, three antipodal cells and two polar nuclei.

(7.43) is similar to Newton’s second law for linear motion expressed symbolically as F = ma Just as force produces acceleration, torque produces angular acceleration in a body. The angular acceleration is directly proportional to the applied torque and is inversely proportional to the moment of inertia of the body. In this respect, Eq.(7 .43) can be called Newton’s second law for rotational motion about a fixed axis.

We already know from there that the time rate of total angular momentum of a system of particles about a point is equal to the total external torque on the system taken about the same point.

When the two photosystems work in a ' W ' series, ﬁrst PS 11 and then the PS I, a process called ‘ non-cyclic photo-phosphorylation occurs. The \ two photosystems are connected through an \ 03% E1 tr electron transport chain, as seen earlier— in the \\ {9 US$13; Z scheme. Both ATP and NADPH + H+ are \ synthesised by this kind of electron ﬂow (Figure 13.5). When only PS I is functional, the electron is circulated within the photosystem and the phosphorylation occurs due to cyclic ﬂow of electrons (Figure 13.6). A possible location where this could be happening is in the stroma lamellae. While the membrane or lamellae of the grana have both PS I and PS 11 the stroma lamellae membranes lack PS II as well as NADP reductase enzyme. The excited electron does not pass on to NADP+ but is cycled back to the PS I complex through the electron transport chain (Figure 13.6). The cyclic ﬂow hence, results only in the synthesis of ATP, but not of NADPH + H“. Cyclic photophosphorylation also occurs when only light of wavelengths beyond 680 nm are available for excitation. Figure 13.6 Cyclic photophosphorylation 13.6.3 Chemiosmotic Hypothesis Let us now ﬂy and understand how actually ATP is synthesised in the chloroplast. The Chemiosmotic hypothesis has been put forward to explain the mechanism. Like in respiration, in photosynthesis too, ATP synthesis is linked to development of a proton gradient across a membrane. This time these are the membranes of thylakoid. There is one difference though, here the proton accumulation is towards the inside of the membrane, i.e., in the lumen. In respiration, protons accumulate in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria when electrons move through the ETS (Chapter 14). Let us understand what causes the proton gradient across the membrane. We need to consider again the processes that take place during the activation of electrons and their transport to determine the steps that cause a proton gradient to develop (Figure 13.7). (a) Since splitting of the water molecule takes place on the inner side of the membrane, the protons or hydrogen ions that are produced by the splitting of water accumulate within the lumen of the thylakoids."

Cholera, typhoid, tetanus, citrus canker are well known diseases caused by different bacteria. Bacteria reproduce mainly by ﬁssion (Figure 2.3). Sometimes, under unfavourable conditions, they produce spores. They also reproduce by a sort of sexual reproduction by adopting a primitive type of DNA transfer from one bacterium to the other. Figure 2.3 A dividing bacterium The Mycoplasma are organisms that completely lack a cell wall. They are the smallest living cells known and can survive without oxygen. Many mycoplasma are pathogenic in animals and plants. 2.2 KINGDOM PROTISTA All single-celled eukaryotes are placed under Protista, but the boundaries of this kingdom are not well deﬁned. What may be ‘a photosynthetic protistan’ to one biologist may be ‘a plant’ to another. In this book we include Chrysophytes, Dinoﬂagellates, Euglenoids, Slime moulds and Protozoans under Protista. Members of Protista are primarily aquatic. This kingdom forms a link with the others dealing with plants, animals and fungi. Being eukaryotes, the protistan cell body contains a well deﬁned nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Some have ﬂagella or cilia. Protists reproduce asexually and sexually by a process involving cell fusion and zygote formation. 2.2. 1 Chrysophytes This group includes diatoms and golden algae (desmids). They are found in fresh water as well as in marine environments. They are microscopic and ﬂoat passively in water currents (plankton). Most of them are photosynthetic. In diatoms the cell walls form two thin overlapping shells, which ﬁt together as in a soap box. The walls are embedded with silica and thus the walls are indestructible. Thus, diatoms have left behind large amount of cell wall deposits in their habitat; this accumulation over billions of years is referred to as ‘diatomaceous earth’. Being gritty this soil is used in polishing, ﬁltration of oils and syrups. Diatoms are the chief ‘producers’ in the oceans."

physics/,"198 PHYSICS recorded in the spring balance is zero since the spring is not stretched at all. If the object were a human being, he or she will not feel his weight since there is no upward force on him. Thus, when an object is in free fall, it is weightless and this phenomenon is usually called the phenomenon of weightlessness. In a satellite around the earth, every part and parcel of the satellite has an acceleration towards the centre of the earth which is exactly the value of earth’s acceleration due to gravity at that position. Thus in the satellite everything inside it is in a state of free fall. This is just as if we were falling towards the earth from a height. Thus, in a manned satellite, people inside experience no gravity. Gravity for us defines the vertical direction and thus for them there are no horizontal or vertical directions, all directions are the same. Pictures of astronauts ﬂoating in a satellite show this fact. SUMMARY 1. Newton’s law of universal gravitation states that the gravitational force of attraction between any two particles of masses m1 and m2 separated by a distance rhas the magnitude mlm2 2 T F=G where G is the universal gravitational constant, which has the value 6.672 ><1(T11 N m2 kg. 2. If we have to find the resultant gravitational force acting on the particle In due to a number of masses M1, M2, ....Mnetc. we use the principle of superposition. Let F1, F2, ....Fn be the individual forces due to M1, M2, ....Mn_ each given by the law of gravitation. From the principle of superposition each force acts independently and uninﬂuenced by the other bodies. The resultant force FR is then found by vector addition n FR=F1+F2+ ...... +Fn=ZFi i=1 where the symbol ‘2' stands for summation. 3. Kepler’s laws of planetary motion state that (a) All planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one of the focal points (b) The radius vector drawn from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal time intervals. This follows from the fact that the force of gravitation on the planet is central and hence angular momentum is conserved. (c) The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi— major axis of the elliptical orbit of the planet The period T and radius R of the circular orbit of a planet about the Sun are related by T2 = 4“2 R3 GMS where MS is the mass of the Sun. Most planets have nearly circular orbits about the Sun. For elliptical orbits, the above equation is valid if R is replaced by the semi—major axis, (L 4. The acceleration due to gravity.

Each of the peripheral ﬁbril is a triplet.The adjacent triplets are also linked. The central part of the proximal region of the centriole is also proteinaceous and called the hub, which is connected with tubules of the peripheral triplets by radial spokes made of protein. The centrioles form the basal body of cilia or ﬂagella, and spindle fibres that give rise to spindle apparatus during cell division in animal cells. 8.5. 10 Nucleus Nucleus as a cell organelle was ﬁrst described by Robert Brown as early as 1 83 1. Later the material of the nucleus stained by the basic dyes was given the name chromatin by Fleming. The interphase nucleus (nucleus of a cell when it is not dividing) has highly extended and elaborate nucleoprotein ﬁbres called chromatin, nuclear matrix and one or more spherical bodies called nucleoli (sing: nucleolus) (Figure 8.1 1). Electron microscopy has revealed that the nuclear envelope, which consists of two parallel membranes with a space between (10 to 50 nm) called the perinuclear Nuaear space, forms a barrier between the membrane materials present inside the nucleus and that of the cytoplasm. The outer membrane usually remains continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum and also bears ribosomes on it. At a number of places the nuclear envelope is interrupted by minute pores, which are formed by the fusion of its two membranes. These nuclear pores are the passages through which movement of RNA and protein molecules takes place in both directions between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Normally, there is only one nucleus per cell, variations in the number of nuclei are also frequently observed. Can you recollect names of organisms that have more than one nucleus per cell? Some mature cells even lack nucleus, e.g., erythrocytes of many mammals and sieve tube cells of vascular plants. Would you consider these cells as ‘living’? The nuclear matrix or the nucleoplasm contains nucleolus and chromatin. The nucleoli are spherical structures present in the nucleoplasm. The content of nucleolus is continuous with the rest of the nucleoplasm as it is not a membrane bound structure. It is a site for active ribosomal RNA synthesis. Larger and more numerous nucleoli are present in cells actively carrying out protein synthesis. Nucleoplasm Nucleolus Nuclear pore"
biology/,"298 BIOLOGY to initiate the contraction of smooth muscles of the bladder and simultaneous relaxation of the urethral sphincter causing the release of urine. The process of release of urine is called micturition and the neural mechanisms causing it is called the micturition reﬂex. An adult human excretes, on an average, 1 to 1.5 litres of urine per day. The urine formed is a light yellow coloured watery ﬂuid which is slightly acidic (pH-6.0) and has a characterestic odour. On an average, 25-30 gm of urea is excreted out per day. Various conditions can affect the characteristics of urine. Analysis of urine helps in clinical diagnosis of many metabolic discorders as well as malfunctioning of the kidney. For example, presence of glucose (Glycosuria) and ketone bodies (Ketonuria) in urine are indicative of diabetes mellitus. 19.7 ROLE OF OTHER ORGANS IN EXCRETION Other than the kidneys, lungs, liver and skin also help in the elimination of excretory wastes. Our lungs remove large amounts of CO2 (approximately 200mL/ minute) and also signiﬁcant quantities of water every day. Liver, the largest gland in our body, secretes bile-containing substances like bilirubin, biliverdin, cholesterol, degraded steroid hormones, vitamins and drugs. Most of these substances ultimately pass out alongwith digestive wastes. The sweat and sebaceous glands in the skin can eliminate certain substances through their secretions. Sweat produced by the sweat glands is a watery ﬂuid containing NaCl, small amounts of urea, lactic acid, etc. Though the primary function of sweat is to facilitate a cooling effect on the body surface, it also helps in the removal of some of the wastes mentioned above. Sebaceous glands eliminate certain substances like sterols, hydrocarbons and waxes through sebum. This secretion provides a protective oily covering for the skin. Do you know that small amounts of nitrogenous wastes could be eliminated through saliva too? 19.8 DISORDERS OF THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM Malfunctioning of kidneys can lead to accumulation of urea in blood, a condition called uremia, which is highly harmful and may lead to kidney failure. In such patients, urea can be removed by a process called hemodialysis. During the process of haemodialysis, the blood drained from a convenient artery is pumped into a dialysing unit called artiﬁcial kidney. Blood drained from a convenient artery is pumped into a dialysing unit after adding an anticoagulant like heparin. The unit contains a coiled cellophane tube surrounded by a ﬂuid (dialysing ﬂuid) having the same"

That is, Acoswt=Acosw(t+T) (14.6) Now the cosine function is periodic with period 27c, i.e., it first repeats itself when the argument changes by 27c.

It also represents a harmonic motion with the point of equilibrium occurring at 1/2 instead of zero. 4 14.4 SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION AND UNIFORM CIRCUIAR MOTION In this section, we show that the projection of uniform circular motion on a diameter of the circle follows simple harmonic motion. A simple experiment (Fig. 14.9) helps us visualise this connection. Tie a ball to the end of a string and make it move in a horizontal plane about a fixed point with a constant angular speed. The ball would then perform a uniform circular motion in the horizontal plane. Observe the ball sideways or from the front, fixing your attention in the plane of motion. The ball will appear to execute to and fro motion along a horizontal line with the point of rotation as the midpoint. You could alternatively observe the shadow of the ball on a wall which is perpendicular to the plane of the circle. In this process what we are observing is the motion of the ball on a diameter of the circle normal to the direction of viewing. Fig. 1 4.9 Circular motion of a ball in a plane viewed edge—on is SHM. Fig. 14.10 describes the same situation mathematically. Suppose a particle P is moving uniformly on a circle of radius A with angular speed a). The sense of rotation is anticlockwise.

Suppose she hears a whistle sounded by the driver of the train. What frequency will she measure or hear? Here both the observer and the source are moving with the same velocity, so there will be no shift in frequency and the passenger will note the natural frequency. But an observer outside who is stationary with respect to the track will note a higher frequency if the train is approaching him and a lower frequency when it recedes from him. Note that we have defined the direction from the observer to the source as the positive direction. Therefore, if the observer is moving towards the source, we has a positive (numerical) value whereas if 0 is moving away from S, DC has a negative value. On the other hand, if S is moving away from 0, US has a positive value whereas if it is moving towards 0, US has a negative value. The sound emitted by the source travels in all directions. It is that part of sound coming towards the observer which the observer receives and detects. Therefore, the relative velocity of sound with respect to the observer is v+ Do in all cases. Example 15.7 A rocket is moving at a speed of 200 m 5’1 towards a stationary target. While moving, it emits a wave of frequency 1000 Hz. Some of the sound reaching the target gets reﬂected back to the rocket as an echo. Calculate (1) the frequency of the sound as detected by the target and (2) the frequency of the echo as detected by the rocket. Answer (1) The observer is at rest and the source is moving with a speed of 200 m S'l. Since this is comparable with the velocity of sound, 330 m S'l, we must use Eq. (15.50) and not the approximate Eq. (15.51). Since the source is approaching a stationary target, v0 = O, and us must be replaced by —vs. Thus, we have —1 v v = v0[l— Ts] v = 1000 HZ X [1 — 200 m S'1/330 m s4]-1 : 2540 HZ (2) The target is now the source (because it is the source of echo) and the rocket’s detector is now the detector or observer (because it detects echo). Thus, vs = O and v0 has a positive value. The frequency of the sound emitted by the source (the target) is v, the frequency intercepted by the target and not v0.

biology/,"BIOMOLECULES 151 9.8 NATURE OF BOND LINKING MONOMERS IN A POLYMER In a polypeptide or a protein, amino acids are linked by a peptide bond which is formed when the carboxyl (-COOH) group of one amino acid reacts with the amino (-NHZ) group of the next amino acid with the elimination of a water moiety (the process is called dehydration). In a polysaccharide the individual monosaccharides are linked by a glycosidic bond. This bond is also formed by dehydration. This bond is formed between two carbon atoms of two adjacent monosaccharides. In a nucleic acid a phosphate moiety links the 3’-carbon of one sugar of one nucleotide to the 5’-carbon of the sugar of the succeeding nucleotide. The bond between the phosphate and hydroxyl group of sugar is an ester bond. As there is one such ester bond on either side, it is called phosphodiester bond (Figure 9.5). Nucleic acids exhibit a wide variety of secondary structures. For example, one of the secondary structures exhibited by DNA is the famous Watson-Crick model. This model says that DNA exists as a double helix. The two strands of polynucleotides are antiparallel i.e., run in the opposite direction. The backbone is formed by the sugar- phosphate-sugar chain. The nitrogen bases are projected more or less perpendicular to this backbone but face inside.

biology/,"36 BIOLOGY organs are produced either on the same or on different thalli. The sporophyte is differentiated into a foot, seta and capsule. After meiosis, spores are produced within the capsule. These spores germinate to form free-living gametophytes. 3.2.2 Mosses The predominant stage of the life cycle of a moss is the gametophyte which consists of two stages. The ﬁrst stage is the protonema stage, which develops directly from a spore. It is a creeping, green, branched and frequently ﬁlamentous stage. The second stage is the leafy stage, which develops from the secondary protonema as a lateral bud. They consist of upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. They are attached to the soil through multicellular and branched rhizoids. This stage bears the sex organs. Vegetative reproduction in mosses is by fragmentation and budding in the secondary protonema. In sexual reproduction, the sex organs antheridia and archegonia are produced at the apex of the leafy shoots. After fertilisation, the zygote develops into a sporophyte, consisting of a foot, seta and capsule. The sporophyte in mosses is more elaborate than that in liverworts. The capsule contains spores. Spores are formed after meiosis. The mosses have an elaborate mechanism of spore dispersal. Common examples of mosses are Funaria, Polytrichum and Sphagnum (Figure 3.2). 3.3 PTERIDOPHYTES The Pteridophytes include horsetails and ferns. Pteridophytes are used for medicinal purposes and as soil-binders. They are also frequently grown as ornamentals. Evolutionarily, they are the ﬁrst terrestrial plants to possess vascular tissues — xylem and phloem. You shall study more about these tissues in Chapter 6. The pteridophytes are found in cool, damp, shady places though some may ﬂourish well in sandy-soil conditions. You may recall that in bryophytes the dominant phase in the life cycle is the gametophytic plant body. However, in pteridophytes, the main plant body is a sporophyte which is differentiated into true root, stem and leaves (Figure 3.3). These organs possess well-differentiated vascular tissues. The leaves in pteridophyta are small (microphylls) as in Selaginella or large (macrophylls) as in ferns. The sporophytes bear sporangia that are subtended by leaf-like appendages called sporophylls. In some cases sporophylls may form distinct compact structures called strobili or cones (Selaginella, Equisetum). The sporangia produce spores by meiosis in spore mother cells. The spores germinate to give rise to inconspicuous, small but multicellular,"

biology/,"PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT embryos are some of the reasons which causes seed dormancy. This dormancy however can be overcome through natural means and various other man-made measures. For example, the seed coat barrier in some seeds can be broken by mechanical abrasions using knives, sandpaper, etc. or vigorous shaking. In nature, these abrasions are caused by microbial action, and passage through digestive tract of animals. Effect of inhibitory substances can be removed by subjecting the seeds to chilling conditions or by application of certain chemicals like gibberellic acid and nitrates. Changing the environmental conditions, such as light and temperature are other methods to overcome seed dormancy. SUMMARY Growth is one of the most conspicuous events in any living organism. It is an irreversible increase expressed in parameters such as size, area, length, height, volume, cell number etc. It conspicuously involves increased protoplasmic material. In plants, meristems are the sites of growth. Root and shoot apical meristems sometimes alongwith intercalary meristem, contribute to the elongation growth of plant axes.

Intercellular‘intrmsw factors are the chemical substances, called plant growth regulators (PGR) There are diverse groups of PGRs 1n plants, principally belonging to ﬁve groups. auxms, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid and ethylene. These PGRs are synthesised in various parts of the plant; they control different differentiation and developmental events. Any PGR has diverse physiological effects on plants. Diverse PGRs also manifest similar effects. PGRs may act synergistically or antagonistically. Plant growth and development is also affected by light, temperature, nutrition, oxygen status, gravity and such external factors. Flowering in some plants is induced only when exposed to certain duration of photoperiod. Depending on the nature of photoperiod requirements, the plants are called short day plants, long day plants and day-neutral plants. Certain plants also need to be exposed to low temperature so as to hasten ﬂowering later in life. This treatement is known as vernalisation. 253"

Amino acids, monosaccharide and disaccharide sugars, fatty acids, glycerol, nucleotides, nucleosides and nitrogen bases are some of the organic compounds seen in living organisms. There are 20 types of amino acids and 5 types of nucleotides. Fats and oils are glycerides in which fatty acids are esteriﬁed to glycerol. Phospholipids contain, in addition, a phosphorylated nitrogenous compound. Only three types of macromolecules, i.e., proteins, nucleic acids and polysaccharides are found in living systems. Lipids, because of their association with membranes separate in the macromolecular fraction. Biomacromolecules are polymers. They are made of building blocks which are different. Proteins are heteropolymers made of amino acids. Nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) are composed of nucleotides. Biomacromolecules have a hierarchy of structures — primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary. Nucleic acids serve as genetic material. Polysaccharides are components of cell wall in plants, fungi and also of the exoskeleton of arthropods. They also are storage forms of energy (e. g., starch and glycogen).

You have already learnt about some of them, e. g., rectilinear motion and motion of a projectile. Both these motions are non-repetitive. We have also learnt about uniform circular motion and orbital motion of planets in the solar system. In these cases, the motion is repeated after a certain interval of time, that is, it is periodic. In your childhood, you must have enjoyed rocking in a cradle or swinging on a swing. Both these motions are repetitive in nature but different from the periodic motion of a planet. Here, the object moves to and fro about a mean position. The pendulum of a wall clock executes a similar motion. Examples of such periodic to and fro motion abound: a boat tossing up and down in a river, the piston in a steam engine going back and forth, etc. Such a motion is termed as oscillatory motion. In this chapter we study this motion. The study of oscillatory motion is basic to physics; its concepts are required for the understanding of many physical phenomena. In musical instruments, like the sitar, the guitar or the violin, we come across vibrating strings that produce pleasing sounds. The membranes in drums and diaphragms in telephone and speaker systems vibrate to and fro about their mean positions. The vibrations of air molecules make the propagation of sound possible. In a solid, the atoms vibrate about their equilibrium positions, the average energi of vibrations being proportional to temperature. AC power supply give voltage that oscillates alternately going positive and negative about the mean value (zero). The description of a periodic motion, in general, and oscillatory motion, in particular, requires some fundamental concepts, like period, frequency, displacement, amplitude and phase. These concepts are developed in the next section. 2019-20"

physics/,"370 PHYSICS sinusoidal wave will be generated propagating in air along the length of the pipe. This is clearly an example of longitudinal waves. The waves considered above, transverse or longitudinal, are travelling or progressive waves since they travel from one part of the medium to another. The material medium as a whole does not move, as already noted. A stream, for example, constitutes motion of water as a whole. In a water wave, it is the disturbance that moves, not water as a whole. Likewise a wind (motion of air as a whole) should not be confused with a sound wave which is a propagation of disturbance (in pressure density) in air, without the motion of air medium as a whole. In transverse waves, the particle motion is normal to the direction of propagation of the wave. Therefore, as the wave propagates, each element of the medium undergoes a shearing strain. Transverse waves can, therefore, be propagated only in those media, which can sustain shearing stress, such as solids and not in ﬂuids. Fluids, as well as, solids can sustain compressive strain; therefore, longitudinal waves can be propagated in all elastic media. For example, in medium like steel, both transverse and longitudinal waves can propagate, while air can sustain only longitudinal waves. The waves on the surface of water are of two kinds: capillary waves and gravity waves. The former are ripples of fairly short wavelength—not more than a few centimetre—and the restoring force that produces them is the surface tension of water. Gravity waves have wavelengths typically ranging from several metres to several hundred meters. The restoring force that produces these waves is the pull of gravity, which tends to keep the water surface at its lowest level. The oscillations of the particles in these waves are not confined to the surface only, but extend with diminishing amplitude to the very bottom. The particle motion in water waves involves a complicated motion—they not only move up and down but also back and forth. The waves in an ocean are the combination of both longitudinal and transverse waves. It is found that, generally, transverse and longitudinal waves travel with different speed in the same medium. 2019-20 Example 1 5. 1 Given below are some examples of wave motion. State in each case if the. wave motion is transverse. longitudinal or a combination of both: (a) Motion of a lq'nk in a longitudinal spring produced by displacing one end of the spring sideways.

Answer (a) Transverse and longitudinal (b) Longitudinal (c) Transverse and longitudinal (d) Longitudinal 4 15.3 DISPLACEMENT RELATION IN APROGRESSIVEWAVE For mathematical description of a travelling wave, we need a function of both position x and time t. Such a function at every instant should give the shape of the wave at that instant. Also, at every given location, it should describe the motion of the constituent of the medium at that location. If we wish to describe a sinusoidal travelling wave (such as the one shown in Fig. 15.3) the corresponding function must also be sinusoidal. For convenience, we shall take the wave to be transverse so that if the position of the constituents of the medium is denoted by x, the displacement from the equilibrium position may be denoted by y. A sinusoidal travelling wave is then described by: y(x,t) = asin(kx—0)t+q)) (15.2) The term {/5 in the argument of sine function means equivalently that we are considering a linear combination of sine and cosine functions: y(x,t) = A sinUoc — cot) + Bcos(kx — cot) (15.3) From Equations (15.2) and (15.3), B a=\/A2 +B2 and ¢= tan'1(Z) To understand why Equation (15.2) represents a sinusoidal travelling wave, take a fixed instant, say t= to. Then, the argument of the sine function in Equation (15.2) is simply"
physics/,"66 PHYSICS just as the ordinary numbers*. For example, if the length and breadth of a rectangle are 1.0 m and 0.5 m respectively, then its perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the four sides, 1.0 m + 0.5 m +1.0 m + 0.5 m = 3.0 m. The length of each side is a scalar and the perimeter is also a scalar. Take another example: the maximum and minimum temperatures on a particular day are 35.6 °C and 24.2 °C respectively. Then, the difference between the two temperatures is 1 1.4 °C. Similarly, if a uniform solid cube of aluminium of side 10 cm has a mass of 2.7 kg, then its volume is 10'3 m3 (a scalar) and its density is 2.7x103 kg m'3 (a scalar). A vector quantity is a quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction and obeys the triangle law of addition or equivalently the parallelogram law of addition. So, a vector is specified by giving its magnitude by a number and its direction. Some physical quantities that are represented by vectors are displacement, velocity, acceleration and force. To represent a vector, we use a bold face type in this book. Thus, a velocity vector can be represented by a symbol v. Since bold face is difficult to produce, when written by hand, a vector is often represented by an arrow placed over a letter, say U. Thus, both v and U represent the velocity vector. The magnitude of a vector is often called its absolute value, indicated by |v| = v. Thus, a vector is represented by a bold face, e.g. byA, a, p, q, r, x, y, with respective magnitudes denoted by light face A, a, p, q, r, x, y. 4.2. 1 Position and Displacement Vectors To describe the position of an object moving in a plane, we need to choose a convenient point, say 0 as origin. Let P and P’ be the positions of the object at time tand t’, respectively [Fig. 4. 1(a)]. We join 0 and P by a straight line. Then, OP is the position vector of the object at time t. An arrow is marked at the head of this line. It is represented by a symbol r, i.e. OP = r. Point P’ is represented by another position vector, OP’ denoted by r’. The length of the vector r represents the magnitude of the vector and its direction is the direction in which P lies as seen from 0. If the object moves from P to P’, the vector PP’ (with tail at P and tip at P’) is called the displacement vector corresponding to motion from point P (at time t) to point P’ (at time t’). (b) Fig. 4.1 [a] Position and displacement vectors. (b) Displacement vector P9 and different courses of motion. It is important to note that displacement vector is the straight line joining the initial and final positions and does not depend on the actual path undertaken by the object between the two positions. For example, in Fig. 4.1(b), given the initial and final positions as P and Q, the displacement vector is the same PQ for different paths of journey, say PABCQ, PDQ, and PBEFQ. Therefore, the magnitude of displacement is either less or equal to the path length of an object between two points. This fact was emphasised in the previous chapter also while discussing motion along a straight line. 4.2.2 Equality of Vectors Two vectors A and B are said to be equal if, and only if, they have the same magnitude and the same direction.** Figure 4.2(a) shows two equal vectors A and B. We can easily check their equality. Shift B parallel to itself until its tail Q coincides with that of A, i.e. Q coincides with 0. Then, since their tips S and P also coincide, the two vectors are said to be equal. In general, equality is indicated * Addition and subtraction of scalars make sense only for quantities with same units. However, you can multiply and divide scalars of different units. ** In our study, vectors do not have ﬁxed locations. So displacing a vector parallel to itself leaves the vector unchanged. Such vectors are called free vectors. However, in some physical applications, location or line of application of a vector is important. Such vectors are called localised vectors. 2019-20"

These hormones increase alertness, pupilary dilation, piloerection (raising of hairs), sweating etc. Both the hormones increase the heart beat, the strength of heart contraction and the rate of respiration.

biology/,"RESPIRATION IN PLANTS synthesise a larger number of ATP molecules needed for cellular metabolism? In eukaryotes these steps take place within the mitochondria and this requires 02. Aerobic respiration is the process that leads to a complete oxidation of organic substances in the presence of oxygen, and releases C02, water and a large amount of energy present in the substrate. This type of respiration is most common in higher organisms. We will look at these processes in the next section. 14.4 AEROBIC RESPIRATION For aerobic respiration to take place within the mitochondria, the ﬁnal product of glycolysis, pyruvate is transported from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria. The crucial events in aerobic respiration are: ‘ The complete oxidation of pyruvate by the stepwise removal of all the hydrogen atoms, leaving three molecules of C02. ° The passing on of the electrons removed as part of the hydrogen atoms to molecular 02 with simultaneous synthesis of ATP. What is interesting to note is that the ﬁrst process takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria while the second process is located on the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Pyruvate, which is formed by the glycolytic catabolism of carbohydrates in the cytosol, after it enters mitochondrial matrix undergoes om'dative decarboxylation by a complex set of reactions catalysed by pyruvic dehydrogenase.

The reaction is catalysed by the enzyme citrate synthase and a molecule of CoA is released. Citrate is then isomerised to isocitrate.

physics/,"360 10. PI IYSICS The frequency v of periodic or oscillatory motion is the number of oscillations per unit time. In the SI, it is measured in hertz : 1 hertz = 1 Hz = 1 oscillation per second = 1s‘1 In simple harmonic motion [SHM], the displacement x (t) of a particle from its equilibrium position is given by, x (t) = A cos (cot + q) ) (displacement), in which A is the amplitude of the displacement, the quantity (cot + (1)] is the phase of the motion, and q) is the phase constant. The angular frequency a) is related to the period and frequency of the motion by, a) = ? = 27W (angular frequency]. Simple harmonic motion can also be viewed as the projection of uniform circular motion on the diameter of the circle in which the latter motion occurs. The particle velocity and acceleration during SHM as functions of time are given by, v (t) = —mA sin (cot + (p) (velocity), a (t) = —w2A cos [cot + (1)] = —(o2x [t] [acceleration], Thus we see that both velocity and acceleration of a body executing simple harmonic motion are periodic functions, having the velocity amplitude vm=coA and acceleration amplitude am =co 2A, respectively. The force acting in a simple harmonic motion is proportional to the displacement and is always directed towards the centre of motion. A particle executing simple harmonic motion has, at any time, kinetic energy K = 1/2 va and potential energy U = 1/2 W. If no friction is present the mechanical energy of the system, E = K + U always remains constant even though K and U change with time. A particle of mass m oscillating under the inﬂuence of Hooke’s law restoring force given by F = — k x exhibits simple harmonic motion with a) = — (angular frequency) T : 275E [period] Such a system is also called a linear oscillator. The motion of a simple pendulum swinging through small angles is approximately simple harmonic. The period of oscillation is given by, T=27£\/E g The mechanical energy in a real oscillating system decreases during oscillations because external forces, such as drag, inhibit the oscillations and transfer mechanical energy to thermal energy. The real oscillator and its motion are then said to be damped. If the 2019-20"
biology/,"BIOMOLECULES The catalytic cycle of an enzyme action can be described in the following steps: 1. First, the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, ﬁtting into the active site. 2. The binding of the substrate induces the enzyme to alter its shape, ﬁtting more tightly around the substrate. 3. The active site of the enzyme, now in close proximity of the substrate breaks the chemical bonds of the substrate and the new enzyme- product complex is formed. 4. The enzyme releases the products of the reaction and the free enzyme is ready to bind to another molecule of the substrate and run through the catalytic cycle once again. 9. 12.4 Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity The activity of an enzyme can be affected by a change in the conditions which can alter the tertiary structure of the protein. These include temperature, pH, change in substrate concentration or binding of speciﬁc chemicals that regulate its activity. Temperature and pH Enzymes generally function in a narrow range of temperature and pH (Figure 9.7). Each enzyme shows its highest activity at a particular temperature and pH called the optimum temperature and optimum pH. Activity declines both below and above the optimum value. Low temperature preserves the enzyme in a temporarily inactive state whereas high temperature destroys enzymatic activity because proteins are denatured by heat.

physics/,"SYSTEMS OI’ PARTICLES AND ROTA'I‘IONAL MOTION Eq. (7 .3 la) and (7 .3 lb) give six independent conditions to be satisfied for mechanical equilibrium of a rigid body. In a number of problems all the forces acting on the body are coplanar. Then we need only three conditions to be satisfied for mechanical equilibrium. Two of these conditions correspond to translational equilibrium; the sum of the components of the forces along any two perpendicular axes in the plane must be zero. The third condition corresponds to rotational equilibrium. The sum of the components of the torques along any axis perpendicular to the plane of the forces must be zero. The conditions of equilibrium of a rigid body may be compared with those for a particle, which we considered in earlier chapters. Since consideration of rotational motion does not apply to a particle, only the conditions for translational equilibrium (Eq. 7.30 a) apply to a particle. Thus, for equilibrium of a particle the vector sum of all the forces on it must be zero. Since all these forces act on the single particle, they must be concurrent. Equilibrium under concurrent forces was discussed in the earlier chapters. A body may be in partial equilibrium, i.e., it may be in translational equilibrium and not in rotational equilibrium, or it may be in rotational equilibrium and not in translational equilibrium. Consider a light (i.e. of negligible mass) rod (AB) as shown in Fig. 7 .20(a). At the two ends (A and B) of which two parallel forces, both equal in magnitude and acting along same direction are applied perpendicular to the rod. Fig. 7.20 (a) Let C be the midpoint of AB, CA = CB = a. the moment of the forces at A and B will both be equal in magnitude (aF), but opposite in sense as shown. The net moment on the rod will be zero. The system will be in rotational equilibrium, but it will not be in translational equilibrium; 2 F 73 0 A B C K1: Fig. 7.20 (b) The force at B in Fig. 7 .20(a) is reversed in Fig. 7 .20(b). Thus, we have the same rod with two forces of equal magnitude but acting in opposite diretions applied perpendicular to the rod, one at end A and the other at end B. Here the moments of both the forces are equal, but they are not opposite; they act in the same sense and cause anticlockwise rotation of the rod. The total force on the body is zero; so the body is in translational equilibrium; but it is not in rotational equilibrium. Although the rod is not fixed in any way, it undergoes pure rotation (i.e. rotation without translation). A pair of forces of equal magnitude but acting in opposite directions with different lines of action is known as a couple or torque. A couple produces rotation without translation. When we open the lid of a bottle by turning it, our ﬁngers are applying a couple to the lid [Fig. 7.2 1(a)]. Another known example is a compass needle in the earth’s magnetic field as shown in the Fig. 7 .2 l (b). The earth’s magnetic field exerts equal forces on the north and south poles. The force on the North Pole is towards the north, and the force on the South Pole is toward the south. Except when the needle points in the north-south direction; the two forces do not have the same line of action. Thus there is a couple acting on the needle due to the earth’s magnetic field. Fig. 7.21(a) Our fingers apply a couple to turn the lid. 2019-20"
biology/,"266 BIOLOGY PEM Dietary deﬁciencies of proteins and total food calories are widespread in many underdeveloped countries of South and South-east Asia, South America, and West and Central Africa. Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) may affect large sections of the population during drought, famine and political turmoil. This happened in Bangladesh during the liberation war and in Ethiopia during the severe drought in mid-eighties. PEM affects infants and children to produce Marasmus and Kwashiorkar. Marasmus is produced by a simultaneous deﬁciency of proteins and calories. It is found in infants less than a year in age, if mother’s milk is replaced too early by other foods which are poor in both proteins and caloric value. This often happens if the mother has second pregnancy or childbirth when the older infant is still too young. In Marasmus, protein deﬁciency impairs growth and replacement of tissue proteins; extreme emaciation of the body and thinning of limbs results, the skin becomes dry, thin and wrinkled. Growth rate and body weight decline considerably. Even growth and development of brain and mental faculties are impaired. Kwashiorkar is produced by protein deﬁciency unaccompanied by calorie deﬁciency. It results ﬁom the replacement of mother’s milk by a high calorie- low protein diet in a child more than one year in age. Like marasmus, kwashiorkor shows wasting of muscles, thinning of limbs, failure of growth and brain development. But unlike marasmus, some fat is still left under the skin; moreover, extensive oedema and swelling of body parts are seen. SUMMARY The digestive system of humans consists of an alimentary canal and associated digestive glands. The alimentary canal consists of the mouth, buccal cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectumﬁiﬁd‘ the anus. The accessory digestive glands include the salivary glands,the liver (with gall bladder) and the pancreas. Inside the mouth the teéth masticates the food, the tongue tastes the food and manipulates it for proper mastication by mixing with the saliva. Saliva contains a starch digestive enzyme, salivary amylase that digests the starch and converts it into maltose (disaccharide). The food then passes into the pharynx and enters the oesophagus in the form of bolus, which is further carried down through the oesophagus by peristalsis into the stomach. In stomach mainly protein digestion takes place. Absorption of simple sugars, alcohol and medicines also takes place in the stomach. The chyme (food) enters into the duodenum portion of the small intestine and is acted on by the pancreatic juice, bile and ﬁnally by the enzymes in the succus entericus, so that the digestion of carbohydrates, proteins and fats is completed. The food then enters into the jejunum and ileum portions of the small intestine. Carbohydrates are digested and converted into monosaccharides like glucose. Proteins are ﬁnally broken down into amino acids. The fats are converted to fatty acids and glycerol."

The function f (t) is then periodic and its period, T, is given by 27: = — ( 1 4 . 3b) 60 Thus, the function f (t) is periodic with period T, f (t) =f(t+T ) The same result is obviously correct if we consider a sine function, f (t) = A sin wt. Further, a linear combination of sine and cosine functions like, f(t) = Asin wt+Bcos cot (14.3c) is also a periodic function with the same period T. Taking, A=Dcos q) and B=Dsin¢ Eq. (14.3c) can be written as, f(t) = D sin (cot + (p) , (14.3d) Here D and q) are constant given by B D=./A2 +32 and ¢= tan—1(2) The great importance of periodic sine and cosine functions is due to a remarkable result proved by the French mathematician, Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768—1830): Any periodic function can be expressed as a superposition of sine and cosine functions of different time periods with suitable coefficients. Example 14.2 Which of the following functions of time represent (a) periodic and (b) non—periodic motion? Give the period for each case of periodic motion (a) is any positive constant].

Now 2 sin (cot + 7c/4)= 6 sin (cot + 7t/4+27t) 2019-20 = 2 sin [w(t + 27c/w) + 7c/4] The periodic time of the function is 27c/ 60. (ii) This is an example of a periodic motion. It can be noted that each term represents a periodic function with a different angular frequency. Since period is the least interval of time after which a function repeats its value, sin cot has a period To: 27c/a); cos 2 cat has a period Tc/a) =T0/ 2; and sin 4 cat has a period 27c/4a) = TO/ 4. The period of the first term is a multiple of the periods of the last two terms. Therefore, the smallest interval of time after which the sum of the three terms repeats is To, and thus, the sum is a periodic function with a period 27c/a). (iii) The function e'm‘ is not periodic, it decreases monotonically with increasing time and tends to zero as t—> co and thus, never repeats its value. (iv) The function log(a)t) increases monotonically with time t. It, therefore, never repeats its value and is a non- pen‘odic function. It may be noted that as t—> 00, log(a)t) diverges to 00. It, therefore, cannot represent any kind of physical displacement. 4 14.3 SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION Consider a particle oscillating back and forth about the origin of an x-axis between the limits +A and —A as shown in Fig. 14.3.

We know that light waves can travel through vacuum. The light emitted by stars, which are hundreds of light years away, reaches us through inter-stellar space, which is practically a vacuum. The most familiar type of waves such as waves on a string, water waves, sound waves, seismic waves, etc. is the so-called mechanical waves. These waves require a medium for propagation, they cannot propagate through vacuum. They involve oscillations of constituent particles and depend on the elastic properties of the medium. The electromagnetic waves that you will learn in Class XII are a different type of wave. Electromagnetic waves do not necessarily require a medium - they can travel through vacuum. Light, radiowaves, X-rays, are all electromagnetic waves. In vacuum, all electromagnetic waves have the same speed c, whose value is : 0:299, 792, 458 HIS—1. (15.1) A third kind of wave is the so-called Matter waves. They are associated with constituents of matter : electrons, protons, neutrons, atoms and molecules. They arise in quantum mechanical description of nature that you will learn in your later studies. Though conceptually more abstract than mechanical or electro-magnetic waves, they have already found applications in several devices basic to modern technology; matter waves associated with electrons are employed in electron microscopes. In this chapter we will study mechanical waves, which require a material medium for their propagation. The aesthetic inﬂuence of waves on art and literature is seen from very early times; yet the first scientific analysis of wave motion dates back to the seventeenth century. Some of the famous scientists associated with the physics of wave motion are Christiaan Huygens (1629- 1695). Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton. The understanding of physics of waves followed the physics of oscillations of masses tied to springs and physics of the simple pendulum. Waves in elastic media are intimately connected with harmonic oscillations. (Stretched strings, coiled springs, air, etc., are examples of elastic media). 2019-20 We shall illustrate this connection through simple examples. Consider a collection of springs connected to one another as shown in Fig. 15.1. If the spring at one end is pulled suddenly and released, the disturbance travels to the other end. What has WWW Fig. 15.1 A collection of springs connected to each other. The end A is pulled suddenly generating a disturbance, which then propagates to the other end. happened? The first spring is disturbed from its equilibrium length. Since the second spring is connected to the first, it is also stretched or compressed, and so on. The disturbance moves from one end to the other; but each spring only executes small oscillations about its equilibrium position. As a practical example of this situation, consider a stationary train at a railway station. Different bogies of the train are coupled to each other through a spring coupling. When an engine is attached at one end, it gives a push to the bogie next to it; this push is transmitted from one bogie to another without the entire train being bodily displaced. Now let us consider the propagation of sound waves in air. As the wave passes through air, it compresses or expands a small region of air. This causes a change in the density of that region, say 6p, this change induces a change in pressure, 6p, in that region. Pressure is force per unit area, so there is a restoring force proportional to the disturbance, just like in a spring. In this case, the quantity similar to extension or compression of the spring is the change in density. If a region is compressed, the molecules in that region are packed together, and they tend to move out to the adjoining region, thereby increasing the density or creating compression in the adjoining region. Consequently, the air in the first region undergoes rarefaction. If a region is comparatively rarefied the surrounding air will rush in making the rarefaction move to the adjoining region. Thus, the compression or rarefaction moves from one region to another, making the propagation of a disturbance possible in air."
physics/,"MECHANICAL 9.1 9.2 9.3 PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS Metals have larger values of Young's modulus than alloys and elastomers. A material with large value of Young's modulus requires a large force to produce small changes in its length. In daily life. we feel that a material which stretches more is more elastic. but it a is misnomer. In fact material which stretches to a lesser extent for a given load is considered to be more elastic. In general. a deforming force in one direction can produce strains in other directions also. The proportionality between stress and strain in such situations cannot be described by just one elastic constant. For example. for a wire under longitudinal strain, the lateral dimensions (radius of cross section) will undergo a small change. which is described by another elastic constant of the material (called Poisson ratio). Stress is not a vector quantity since. unlike a force. the stress cannot be assigned a specific direction. Force acting on the portion of a body on a speciﬁed side of a section has a deﬁnite direction.

physics/,"MOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 41 negative sign indicates the direction of displacement. Thus, it is not necessary to use vector notation for discussing motion of objects in one-dimension. The magnitude of displacement may or may not be equal to the path length traversed by an object. For example, for motion of the car from O to P, the path length is +360 m and the displacement is +360 m. In this case, the magnitude of displacement (360 m) is equal to the path length (360 m). But consider the motion of the car from O to P and back to Q. In this case, the path length = (+360 m) + (+120 m) = + 480 m. However, the displacement = (+240 m) — (0 m) = + 240 m. Thus, the magnitude of displacement (240 m) is not equal to the path length (480 m). The magnitude of the displacement for a course of motion may be zero but the corresponding path length is not zero. For example, if the car starts from 0, goes to P and x (m) 40 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 t(S) (a) then returns to O, the final position coincides with the initial position and the displacement is zero. However, the path length of this journey isOP+PO=360m+ 360m=720m. Motion of an object can be represented by a position-time graph as you have already learnt about it. Such a graph is a powerful tool to represent and analyse different aspects of motion of an object. For motion along a straight line, say X-axis, only x—coordinate varies with time and we have an x—t graph. Let us first consider the simple case in which an object is stationary, e. g. a car standing still at x = 40 m. The position-time graph is a straight line parallel to the time axis, as shown in Fig. 3.2(a). If an object moving along the straight line covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, it is said to be in uniform motion along a straight line.

On the basis of the mode of (b) pouring of their secretions, glands are divided into two categories namely glands secrete mucus, saliva, earwax, oil, milk, digestive enzymes and other cell products. These products are released through ducts or tubes. In contrast, endocrine glands do not have ducts. Their products called hormones are secreted directly into the ﬂuid bathing the gland. Compound epithelium is made of more than one layer (multi—layered) of cells and thus has a limited role in secretion and absorption Wigure 7 .3). Their main function is to provide protection against chemical and mechanical stresses. They cover the dry surface of the skin, the moist surface of buccal cavity, pharynx, inner lining of ducts of salivary glands and of pancreatic ducts. All cells in epithelium are held together with little intercellular material. In nearly all animal tissues, specialised junctions provide both structural and functional links between its individual cells. Three types of cell j unctions are found in the epithelium and other tissues. These are called as tight, adhering and gap junctions. Tight junctions help to stop substances from leaking across a tissue. Adhering junctions perform cementing to keep neighbouring cells together. Gap junctions facilitate the cells to communicate with each other by connecting the cytoplasm of adjoining cells, for rapid transfer of ions, small molecules and sometimes big molecules. 7. 1 .2 Connective Tissue Connective tissues are most abundant and widely distributed in the body of complex animals.

To handle a typical problem in mechanics systematically, one should use the following steps : (1) Draw a diagram showing schematically the various parts of the assembly of bodies, the links, supports, etc. (ii) Choose a convenient part of the assembly as one system. (iii) Draw a separate diagram which shows this system and all the forces on the system by the remaining part of the assembly. Include also the forces on the system by other agencies. Do not include the forces on the environment by the system. A diagram of the net force on the block must be zero i.e., R = 20 N. Using third law the action of the block (i.e. the force exerted on the ﬂoor by the block) is equal to 20 N and directed vertically downwards. (b) The system (block + cylinder) accelerates downwards with 0.1 m s2. The free-body diagram of the system shows two forces on the system : the force of gravity due to the earth (270 N); and the normal force R’ by the ﬂoor. Note, the free-body diagram of the system does not show the internal forces between the block and the cylinder. Applying the second law to the system, this type is known as ‘a free-body diagram’. (Note this does not imply that the system under consideration is without a net force). (iv) In a free-body diagram, include information R about forces (their magnitudes and directions) that are either given or you are u sure of (e.g., the direction of tension in a 20 N Free-body diagram of the block 270 — R’ = 27 X 0.1N 16. R’ = 267.3 N string along its length). The rest should be treated as unknowns to be determined using laws of motion. (v) If necessary, follow the same procedure for another choice of the system. In doing so, ""'I R' employ Newton’s third law. That is, if in the I free-body diagram of A, the force on A due to B is shown as F, then in the free-body diagram of B, the force on B due to A should be shown as —F. 270 N The following example illustrates the above X gfigebgﬁilgfiarirnder procedure. 5 stem 0.1 m 5'2 y F Example 5.12 See Fig. 5.15.

We walk, run and ride a bicycle. Even when we are sleeping, air moves into and out of our lungs and blood ﬂows in arteries and veins. We see leaves falling from trees and water ﬂowing down a dam. Automobiles and planes carry people from one place to the other. The earth rotates once every twenty-four hours and revolves round the sun once in a year. The sun itself is in motion in the Milky Way, which is again moving within its local group of galaxies. Motion is change in position of an object with time. How does the position change with time ? In this chapter, we shall learn how to describe motion. For this, we develop the concepts of velocity and acceleration. We shall confine ourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight line, also known as rectilinear motion. For the case of rectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple equations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative nature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity. In our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as point objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size of the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a reasonable duration of time. In a good number of situations in real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can be considered as point-like objects without much error. In Kinematics, we study ways to describe motion without going into the causes of motion. What causes motion described in this chapter and the next chapter forms the subject matter of Chapter 5. 3.2 POSITION. PATH LENGTH AND DISPLACEMENT Earlier you learnt that motion is change in position of an object with time. In order to specify position, we need to use a reference point and a set of axes.

physics/,"160 PHYSICS 9/ Fig. 7.21(b) The Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld exerts equal and opposite forces on the poles of a compass needle. These two forces form a couple. ’ Example 7.7 Show that moment of a couple does not depend on the point about which you take the moments. Fig. 7.22 Consider a couple as shown in Fig. 7 .22 acting on a rigid body. The forces F and -F act respectively at points B and A. These points have position vectors 1'1 and 1'2 with respect to origin 0. Let us take the moments of the forces about the origin. The moment of the couple = sum of the moments of the two forces making the couple =r1x (—F) + r2xF =5xF—ng = (1-2—1'1) x F But r1 + AB = r2, and hence AB = r2 — 1-1. The moment of the couple, therefore, is AB x F. Clearly this is independent of the origin, the point about which we took the moments of the forces. 4 7.8.1 Principle of moments An ideal lever is essentially a light (i.e. of negligible mass) rod pivoted at a point along its 2019-20 length. This point is called the fulcrum. A see- saw on the children’s playground is a typical example of a lever. Two forces F1 and F2, parallel to each other and usually perpendicular to the lever, as shown here, act on the lever at distances cl1 and d2 respectively from the fulcrum as shown in Fig. 7.23. R <— ¢ 0 d. —> A B l F1 F. ) Fig. 7.23 The lever is a system in mechanical equilibrium. Let R be the reaction of the support at the fulcrum; R is directed opposite to the forces F1 and F2. For translational equilibrium, R—ﬁ—g=o m For considering rotational equilibrium we take the moments about the fulcrum; the sum of moments must be zero, le1 — d2F2 = 0 (ii) Normally the anticlockwise (clockwise) moments are taken to be positive (negative). Note R acts at the fulcrum itself and has zero moment about the fulcrum. In the case of the lever force F1 is usually some weight to be lifted. It is called the load and its distance from the fulcrum d1 is called the load arm. Force F2 is the effort applied to lift the load; distance d2 of the effort from the fulcrum is the effort arm. Eq. (ii) can be written as le1 = d2 F2 (7. 32a) or load arm x load = effort arm x effort The above equation expresses the principle of moments for a lever. Incidentally the ratio F1 /F2 is called the Mechanical Advantage (M.A.); E_d2 MA. = F2 d (7 .32b) 1 If the effort arm d2 is larger than the load arm, the mechanical advantage is greater than one. Mechanical advantage greater than one means that a small effort can be used to lift a large load. There are several examples of a lever around you besides the see-saw. The beam of a balance is a lever. Try to find more such"
biology/,"134 BIOLOGY face and concave trans or the maturing face. The cis and the trans faces of the organelle are entirely different, but interconnected. The golgi apparatus principally performs the function of packaging materials, to be delivered either to the intra—cellular targets or secreted outside the cell. Materials to be packaged in the form of vesicles from the ER fuse with the cis face of the golgi apparatus and move towards the maturing face. This explains, Why the golgi apparatus remains in close association with the endoplasmic reticulum. A number of proteins synthesised by ribosomes on the endoplasmic reticulum are modiﬁed in the cisternae of the golgi apparatus before they are released from its trans face. Golgi apparatus is the important site of formation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. 8.5.3.3 Lysosomes These are membrane bound vesicular structures formed by the process of packaging in the golgi apparatus. The isolated lysosomal vesicles have been found to be very rich in almost all types of hydrolytic enzymes (hydrolases — lipases, proteases, carbohydrases) optimally active at the acidic pH. These enzymes are capable of digesting carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. 8.5.3.4 Vacuoles ’Ihe vacuole is the membrane-bound space found in the cytoplasm. It contains water, sap, excretory product and other materials not useful for the cell. The vacuole is bound by a single membrane called tonoplast. In plant cells the vacuoles can occupy up to 90 per cent of the volume of the cell. In plants, the tonoplast facilitates the transport of a number of ions and other materials against concentration gradients into the vacuole, hence their concentration is signiﬁcantly higher in the vacuole than in the cytoplasm. In Amoeba the contractile vacuole is important for osmoregulation and excretion. In many cells, as in protists, food vacuoles are formed by engulﬁng the food particles. 8. 5.4 Mitochondria Mitochondria (sing.: mitochondrion), unless speciﬁcally stained, are not easily visible under the microscope. The number of mitochondria per cell is variable depending on the physiological activity of the cells. In terms of shape and size also, considerable degree of variability is observed. Typically it is sausage-shaped or cylindrical having a diameter of 0.2- 1 .0m (average 0.5um) and length 1 .0-4. 1 mm. Each mitochondrion is a double"

After a time t, it 2 covers an angle of at in the clockwise T sense and makes an angle of (g — 2%t) with the x—axis. The projection of OP on the x—axis at time t is given by x(t) =Bcos (2—2115) 2 T = Bsin (zit) T For T=3O s, x(t) =Bsin (1 t) 15 Writing this as x (t) = B cos (ﬁt — g] , and comparing with Eq. (14.4). We find that this represents a SHM of amplitude B, period 30 s, and an initial phase of —g. 4 14.5 VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION IN SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION The speed of a particle v in uniform circular motion is its angular speed (0 times the radius of the circle A. v= (0A (14.8) The direction of velocity 9 at a time t is along the tangent to the circle at the point where the particle is located at that instant. From the geometry of Fig. 14. 1 1, it is clear that the velocity of the projection particle P’ at time t is v(t) = —wA sin (wt + (p) (14.9) Fig. 1 4.1 1 The velocity, v (t), of the particle P’ is the projection of the velocity 6 of the reference particle, P. 2019-20 where the negative sign shows that v (t) has a direction opposite to the positive direction of x—axis. Eq. (14.9) gives the instantaneous velocity of a particle executing SHM, where displacement is given by Eq. (14.4). We can, of course, obtain this equation without using geometrical argument, directly by differentiating (Eq. 14.4) with respect of t: v(t)=%x(t) (14.10) The method of reference circle can be similarly used for obtaining instantaneous acceleration of a particle undergoing SHM. We know that the centripetal acceleration of a particle P in uniform circular motion has a magnitude v2/A or cozA, and it is directed towards the centre i.e., the direction is along P0. The instantaneous acceleration of the projection particle P’ is then (See Fig. 14.12) a (t) = —a)2A cos (wt + (1)) = —a)2x(t) (14.11) Fig. 1 4. 1 2 The acceleration, a(t), of the particle P’is the projection of the acceleration a of the reference particle P. Eq. (14.1 1) gives the acceleration of a particle in SHM. The same equation can again be obtained directly by differentiating velocity v(t) given by Eq. (14.9) with respect to time: d =_ (14.12) a(t) dt v(t) We note from Eq. (14.1 1) the important property that acceleration of a particle in SHM is proportional to displacement. For X(t) > O, a(t) < 0 and for x(t) < O, a(t) > O. Thus,whatever"
physics/,"28 PI IYSICS the first uncertain digit are known as signiﬁcant digits or signiﬁcant ﬁgures. If we say the period of oscillation of a simple pendulum is 1.62 s, the digits 1 and 6 are reliable and certain, while the digit 2 is uncertain. Thus, the measured value has three significant figures. The length of an object reported after measurement to be 287.5 cm has four significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are certain while the digit 5 is uncertain. Clearly, reporting the result of measurement that includes more digits than the significant digits is superﬂuous and also misleading since it would give a wrong idea about the precision of measurement. The rules for determining the number of significant figures can be understood from the following examples. Significant figures indicate, as already mentioned, the precision of measurement which depends on the least count of the measuring instrument. A choice of change of different units does not change the number of signiﬁcant digits or ﬁgures in a measurement. This important remark makes most of the following observations clear: (1) For example, the length 2.308 cm has four significant figures. But in different units, the same value can be written as 0.02308 m or 23.08 mm or 23080 um. All these numbers have the same number of significant figures (digits 2, 3, 0, 8), namely four. This shows that the location of decimal point is of no consequence in determining the number of significant figures. The example gives the following rules : 0 All the non-zero digits are signiﬁcant. 0 All the zeros between two non-zero digits are significant, no matter where the decimal point is, if at all. 0 If the number is less than 1, the zero(s) on the right of decimal point but to the left of the ﬁrst non-zero digit are not signiﬁcant. [In 0% 2308, the underlined zeroes are not significant]. 0 The terminal or trailing zero(s) in a number without a decimal point are not significant. [Thus 123 m = 12300 cm = 123000 mm has three significant figures, the trailing zero(s) being not significant.] However, you can also see the next observation. 2019-20 0 The trailing zero(s) in a number with a decimal point are signiﬁcant. [The numbers 3.500 or 0.06900 have four significant figures each.] (2) There can be some confusion regarding the trailing zero(s). Suppose a length is reported to be 4.700 m. It is evident that the zeroes here are meant to convey the precision of measurement and are, therefore, significant. [If these were not, it would be superﬂuous to write them explicitly, the reported measurement would have been simply 4.7 m]. Now suppose we change units, then 4.700 m = 470.0 cm = 4700 mm = 0.004700 km Since the last number has trailing zero(s) in a number with no decimal, we would conclude erroneously from observation (1) above that the number has two significant figures, while in fact, it has four significant figures and a mere change of units cannot change the number of significant figures. (3) To remove such ambiguities in determining the number of significant figures, the best way is to report every measurement in scientiﬁc notation (in the power of 10). In this notation, every number is expressed as a X 10b, where a is a number between 1 and 10, and b is any positive or negative exponent (or power) of 10. In order to get an approximate idea of the number, we may round off the number a to 1 (for a g 5) and to 10 (for 5<ag 10). Then the number can be expressed approximately as 10b in which the exponent (or power) b of 10 is called order of magnitude of the physical quantity. When only an estimate is required, the quantity is of the order of 10’. For example, the diameter of the earth (1.28X107m) is of the order of 107m with the order of magnitude 7. The diameter of hydrogen atom (1.06 x 10mm) is of the order of 10mm, with the order of magnitude —10. Thus, the diameter of the earth is 17 orders of magnitude larger than the hydrogen atom. It is often customary to write the decimal after the first digit. Now the confusion mentioned in (a) above disappears : 4.700 m = 4.700 X 102 cm = 4.700 X 103 mm = 4.700 X 10'3 km The power of 10 is irrelevant to the determination of significant figures. However, all"

For example, to ascertain the speed of an aircraft, one must have an accurate method to find its positions at closely separated instants of time. This was the actual motivation behind the discovery of radar in World War 11. Think of different examples in modern science where precise measurements of length, time, mass etc. are needed.

geography/,"HOBZCHO] CHAPTER ‘- rou have studied geography as one of the components of your Social Science course upto the secondary stage. You are already aware of some of the phenomena of geographical nature in the world and its different parts. Now, you will study ‘Geography’ as an independent subject and learn about the physical environment of the earth, human activities and their interactive relationships. Therefore, a pertinent question you can ask at this stage is — Why should we study geography? We live on the surface of the earth. Our lives are affected by our surroundings in many ways. We depend on the resources to sustain ourselves in the surrounding areas. Primitive societies subsisted on ‘natural means of subsistence’, i.e. edible plants and animals. With the passage of time, we developed technologies and started producing our food using natural resources such as land, soil and water. We adjusted our food habits and clothing according to the prevailing weather conditions. There are variations in the natural resource base, technological development, adaptation with and modification of physical environment, social organisations and cultural development. As a student of geography, you should be curious to know about all the phenomena which vary over space. You learn about the diverse lands and people. You should also be interested in understanding the changes which have taken place over time. Geography equips you to appreciate diversity and investigate into the causes responsible for creating such variations over time and space. You will develop skills to understand the globe converted into maps and have a visual sense GEOGRAPHY AS A DISCIPLINE of the earth’s surface. The understanding and the skills obtained in modern scientific techniques such as GIS and computer cartography equip you to meaningfully contribute to the national endeavour for development. Now the next question which you may like to ask is — What is geography? You know that earth is our home. It is also the home of many other creatures, big and small, which live on the earth and sustain. The earth’s surface is not uniform. It has variations in its physical features. There are mountains, hills, valleys, plains, plateaus, oceans, lakes, deserts and wilderness. There are variations in its social and cultural features too. There are villages, cities, roads, railways, ports, markets and many other elements created by human beings across the entire period of their cultural development. This variation provides a clue to the understanding of the relationship between the physical environment and social / cultural features. The physical environment has provided the stage, on which human societies enacted the drama of their creative skills with the tools and techniques which they invented and evolved in the process of their cultural development. Now, you should be able to attempt the answer of the question posed earlier as to “What is geography”? In very simple words, it can be said that geography is the description of the earth. The term geography was first coined by Eratosthenese, a Greek scholar (276- 1 94 BC.). The word has been derived from two roots from Greek language geo (earth) and graphos (description). 2019-2020"

Beijerinek (1898) demonstrated that the extract of the infected plants of tobacco could cause infection in healthy plants and called the ﬂuid as Contagium vivumﬂuidum (infectious living ﬂuid). W.M. Stanley (1935) showed that Viruses could be crystallised and crystals consist largely of proteins. They are inert outside their speciﬁc host cell. Viruses are obligate parasites. In addition to proteins, viruses also contain genetic material, that could be either RNA or DNA. No virus contains both RNA and DNA. A virus is a nucleoprotein and the genetic material is infectious. In general, viruses that infect plants have single stranded RNA and viruses that infect animals have either single or double stranded RNA or double stranded DNA. Bacterial viruses or bacteriophages (viruses that infect the bacteria) are usually double stranded DNA viruses (Figure 2.6b). The protein coat called capsid made of small subunits called capsomeres, protects the nucleic acid. These capsomeres are arranged in helical or polyhedral geometric forms. Viruses cause diseases like mumps, small pox, herpes and inﬂuenza. AIDS in humans is also caused by a virus. In plants, the symptoms can be mosaic formation, leaf rolling and curling, yellowing and vein clearing, dwarﬂng and stunted growth. 201 9-2020"

(15.33) refers to the so-called constructive interference of the two waves where the amplitudes add up in the resultant wave. Eq. (15.34) intereference where the amplitudes subtract out in the resultant wave. Fig. 15.10 shows these two cases of interference of waves arising from the principle of superposition. 15.6 REFLECTION OF WAVES So far we considered waves propagating in an unbounded medium. What happens if a pulse or a wave meets a : "" is the case of destructive “mm reﬂected. The phenomenon of echo is an example of reﬂection by a rigid boundary. If the boundary is not completely rigid or is an interface between two different elastic media, the situation is some what complicated. A part of the incident wave is reﬂected and a part is transmitted into the second medium. If a wave is incident obliquely on the boundary between two different media the transmitted wave is called the refracted wave. The incident and refracted waves obey Snell’s law of refraction, and the incident and reflected waves obey the usual laws of reﬂection. Fig. 15.1 1 shows a pulse travelling along a stretched string and being reﬂected by the boundary. Assuming there is no absorption of energy by the boundary, the reﬂected wave has the same shape as the incident pulse but it suffers a phase change of 7c or 1800 on reﬂection. This is because the boundary is rigid and the disturbance must have zero displacement at all times at the boundary. By the principle of superposition, this is possible only if the reﬂected and incident waves differ by a phase of 7:, so that the resultant displacement is zero. This reasoning is based on boundary condition on a rigid wall. We can arrive at the same conclusion dynamically also. As the pulse arrives at the wall, it exerts a force on the wall. By Newton’s Third Law, the wall exerts an equal and opposite force on the string generating a reﬂected pulse that differs by a phase of 7c. ..‘\\\“ .. —> O .l\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ n\\\\\\\‘ u' v v v I v v v v I v v v v v v v v v v ! v v v v f 5 g M“\\\‘ .“‘. ,- W. —> a l I I. \ :.“ I. .h. a l O A‘““““““““““““““““‘“““““V‘ .K“‘\“- a I I Q : 7II.'lI.I'll'l'l'lIIII'I'I'I'll'lllllllll'l'l"" ‘rllllll- § I O ‘ > O \ ""4.11! “ h boundary?

In this case effectively four light hydrogen nuclei fuse to form a helium nucleus whose mass is less than the sum of the masses of the reactants. This mass difference, called the mass defect Am is the source of energy (Am)02. In fission, a heavy nucleus like uranium 25251}, is split by a neutron into lighter nuclei. Once again the final mass is less than the initial mass and the mass difference translates into energy, which can be tapped to provide electrical energy as in nuclear power plants (controlled nuclear ﬁssion) or can be employed in making nuclear weapons (uncontrolled nuclear ﬁssion). Strictly, the energy AE released in a chemical reaction can also be related to the mass defect Am = AE/CZ.

biology/,"ANIMAL KINGDOM SUMMARY The basic fundamental features such as level of organisation, symmetry, cell organisation, coelom, segmentation, notochord, etc., have enabled us to broadly classify the animal kingdom. Besides the fundamental features, there are many other distinctive characters which are specific for each phyla or class. Porifera includes multicellular animals which exhibit cellular level of organisation and have characteristic ﬂagellated choanocytes. The coelenterates have tentacles and bear cnidoblasts. They are mostly aquatic, sessile or ﬁ‘ee-ﬂoating. The ctenophores are marine animals with comb plates. The platyhelminths have ﬂat body and exhibit bilateral symmetry. The parasitic forms show distinct suckers and hooks. Aschelminthes are pseudocoelomates and include parasitic as well as non- parasitic roundworms. Annelids are metamerically segmented animals with a true coelom. The arthropods are the most abundant group of animals characterised by the presence of j01nted appendages. The molluscs have a sp’ft body surrounded by an external calcareous shell. The body 1s covered mth‘ve ﬁg. mal Skeleton made of chitin. The echinoderms possess a spiny skin.

They a» 4; are the most primitive chordates and "" gectoparas1tes on ﬁshes. Gnathostomata has two super classes, Piscesu and Tetrapoda. Classes Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes bear ﬁns for locomotion and are grouped under Pisces. The Chondrichthyes are ﬁshes with cartilaginous endoskeleton and are marine. Classes, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves and Mammalia have two pairs of limbs and are thus grouped under Tetrapoda. The amphibians have adapted to live both on land and water. Reptiles are characterised by the presence of dry and corniﬁed skin. Limbs are absent in snakes. Fishes, amphibians and reptiles are poikilothermous (cold- blooded). Aves are warm-blooded animals with feathers on their bodies and forelimbs modiﬁed into wings for ﬂying. Hind limbs are adapted for walking, swimming, perching or clasping. The unique features of mammals are the presence of mammary glands and hairs on the skin. They commonly exhibit viviparity. 61"
geography/,"11092CH16 BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION ‘- 7 ou have already learnt about the geomorphic processes particularly weathering and depth of weathering mantle in different climatic zones. See the Figure 6.2 in Chapter 6 in order to recapitulate. You should know that this weathering mantle is the basis for the diversity of vegetation and hence, the biodiversity. The basic cause for such weathering variations and resultant biodiversity is the input of solar energy and water. No wonder that the areas that are rich in these inputs are the areas of wide spectrum of biodiversity. Biodiversity as we have today is the result of 2.5-3.5 billion years of evolution. Before the advent of htunans, our earﬂi supported more biodiversity than in any other period. Since, the emergence of humans, however, biodiversity has begun a rapid decline, with one species after another bearing the brunt of extinction due to overuse. The number of species globally vary from 2 million to 100 million, with 10 million being the best estimate. Nevv species are regulally discovered most of which are yet to be classified (an estimate states that about 40 per cent of fresh water fishes from South America are not classified yet). Tropical forests are very rich in bio-diversity. Biodiversity is a system in constant evolution, from a view point of species, as well as from view point of an individual organism. The average half-life of a species is estimated at between one and four million years, and 99 per cent of the species that have ever lived on CHAPTER E. the earth are today extinct. Biodiversity is not found evenly on the earth. It is consistently richer in the tropics. As one approaches the polar regions, one finds larger and larger populations of fewer and fewer species. Biodiversity itself is a combination of two words, Bio (life) and diversity (variety). In simple terms, biodiversity is the number and variety of organisms found within a specified geographic region. It refers to the varieties of plants, animals and micro-organisms, the genes they contain and the ecosystems they form. It relates to the variability among living organisms on the earth, including the variability within and between the species and that within and between the ecosystems. Biodiversity is our living wealth. It is a result of hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary history. Biodiversity can be discussed at three levels : (i) Genetic diversity; (ii) Species diversity; (iii) Ecosystem diversity. Genetic Diversity Genes are the basic building blocks of various life forms. Genetic biodiversity refers to the variation of genes within species. Groups of individual organisms having certain similarities in their physical characteristics are called species. Human beings genetically belong to the homo sapiens group and also differ in their characteristics such as height, colour, physical appearance, etc., considerably. This is due to genetic diversity. This genetic diversity is essential for a healthy breeding of population of species. 2019-2020"

Generally geography curricula is taught and learnt in this format but this format is not static. Any discipline is bound to grow with new ideas, problems, methods and techniques. For example, what was once manual cartography has now been transformed into computer cartography. Technology has enabled scholars to handle large quantum of data. The internet provides extensive information. Thus, the capacity to attempt analysis has increased tremendously. GIS has further opened vistas of knowledge. GPS has become a handy tool to find out exact locations. Technologies have enhanced the capacity of attempting synthesis with sound theoretical understanding. You will learn some preliminary aspects of these techniques in your book, Practical work in Geography — Part I (NCERT, 2006). You will continue to improve upon your skills and learn about their application. PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY AND ITS IMPORTANCE This chapter appears in the book entitled Fundamentals of Physical Geography.

physics/,"116 PHYSICS 6.2 NOTIONS OF WORK AND KINETIC ENERGY: THE WORK-ENERGY THEOREM The following relation for rectilinear motion under constant acceleration a has been encountered in Chapter 3, v2 — u2 = 2 as (6.2) where u and v are the initial and final speeds and s the distance traversed. Multiplying both sides by m/ 2, we have 1 2 1 2 —mv ——mu =mas=Fs , 2 2 (6 2a) where the last step follows from Newton’s Second Law. We can generalise Eq. (6.2) to three dimensions by employing vectors v2— u2= 2 a.d Here a and d are acceleration and displacement vectors of the object respectively. Once again multiplying both sides by m/ 2 , we obtain 1 2 l Emu Emu2 = m a.d = F.d (6,2b) The above equation provides a motivation for the definitions of work and kinetic energy. The left side of the equation is the difference in the quantity ‘half the mass times the square of the speed’ from its initial value to its final value. We call each of these quantities the ‘kinetic energy’, denoted by K. The right side is a product of the displacement and the component of the force along the displacement. This quantity is called ‘work’ and is denoted by W. Eq. (6.2b) is then Kf— K: W (6.3) where K. and Kf are respectively the initial and final kinetic energies of the object. Work refers to the force and the displacement over which it acts. Work is done by a force on the body over a certain displacement. Equation (6.2) is also a special case of the work-energy (WE) theorem : The change in kinetic energy of a particle is equal to the work done on it by the net force. We shall generalise the above derivation to a varying force in a later section. b Example 6.2 It is well known that a raindrop falls under the inﬂuence of the downward gravitational force and the opposing resistive force. The latter is known 2019-20 to be proportional to the speed of the drop but is otherwise undetermined. Consider a drop of mass 1.00 g falling from a height 1.00 km. It hits the ground with a speed of 50.0 m s ’. (a) What is the work done by the gravitational force ? What is the work done by the unknown resistive force? Answer (a) The change in kinetic energy of the drop is AK=lmv2 —O 2 1 —3 25x10 x50><50 =1.25J where we have assumed that the drop is initially at rest. Assuming that g is a constant with a value 10 m / s2, the work done by the gravitational force is, W = mgh 9 = 10'3 x10 ><103 = 10.0 J (b) From the work-energy theorem AK : Wg + Wr where WT is the work done by the resistive force on the raindrop. Thus Wr = AK — W9 = 1.25 — 10 = — 8.75 J is negative. 4 6.3 WORK As seen earlier, work is related to force and the displacement over which it acts.

Yet, if the total external force acting on the system is zero, the centre of mass moves with a constant velocity, i.e., moves uniformly in a straight line like a free particle. The vector Eq. (7.1 8a) is equivalent to three scalar equations, Px=cl,Py=CZansz=c3 (7.18b) Here PX, Py and PZ are the components of the total linear momentum vector P along the x—, y— and z—axes respectively; Cl, 02 and 03 are constants.

(b) The same spliting of the heavy nucleus radium (Ra) with the centre of mass at rest. The two product particles ﬂy back to back. As an example, let us consider the radioactive decay of a moving unstable particle, like the nucleus of radium. A radium nucleus disintegrates into a nucleus of radon and an alpha particle. The forces leading to the decay are internal to the system and the external forces on the system are negligible. So the total linear momentum of the system is the same before and after decay. The two particles produced in the decay, the radon nucleus and the alpha particle, move in different directions in such a way that their centre of mass moves along the same path along which the original decaying radium nucleus was moving [Fig. 7.13(a)]. If we observe the decay from the frame of reference in which the centre of mass is at rest, the motion of the particles involved in the decay looks particularly simple; the product particles 2019-20 Fig. 7.14 (a) Trajectories of two stars, 81 (dotted line) and 52 (solid line) forming a binary system with their centre of mass C in uniform motion. (b) The same binary system, with the centre of mass C at rest. move back to back with their centre of mass remaining at rest as shown in Fig.7.13 (b). In many problems on the system of particles, as in the above radioactive decay problem, it is convenient to work in the centre of mass frame rather than in the laboratory frame of reference. In astronomy, binary (double) stars is a common occurrence. If there are no external forces, the centre of mass of a double star moves like a free particle, as shown in Fig.7 . 14 (a). The trajectories of the two stars of equal mass are also shown in the figure; they look complicated. If we go to the centre of mass frame, then we find that there the two stars are moving in a circle, about the centre of mass, which is at rest. Note that the position of the stars have to be diametrically opposite to each other [Fig. 7 . 14(b)]. Thus in our frame of reference, the trajectories of the stars are a combination of (i) uniform motion in a straight line of the centre of mass and (ii) circular orbits of the stars about the centre of mass. As can be seen from the two examples, separating the motion of different parts of a system into motion of the centre of mass and motion about the centre of mass is a very useful technique that helps in understanding the motion of the system. 7.5 VECTOR PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS We are already familiar with vectors and their use in physics. In chapter 6 (Work, Energy, Power) we defined the scalar product of two vectors. An important physical quantity, work, is defined as a scalar product of two vector quantities, force and displacement."

Water moves out; it is ﬁrst lost from the cytoplasm and then from the vacuole. The water when drawn out of the cell through diffusion into the extracellular (outside cell) ﬂuid causes the protoplast to shrink away from the walls. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. The movement of water occurred across the membrane moving from an area of high water potential (i.e., the cell) to an area of lower water potential outside the cell (Figure 1 1.5). What occupies the space between the cell wall and the shrunken protoplast in the plasmolysed cell? When the cell (or tissue) is placed in an isotonic solution, there is no net ﬂow of water towards the inside or outside. If the external solution balances the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm it is said to be isotonic. When water ﬂows into the cell and out of the cell and are in equilibrium, the cells are said to be ﬂaccid. The process of plasmolysis is usually reversible. When the cells are placed in a hypotonic solution (higher water potential or dilute solution as compared to the cytoplasm), water diffuses into the cell causing the cytoplasm to build up a pressure against the wall, that is called turgor pressure. The pressure exerted by the protoplasts due to entry of water against the rigid walls is called pressure potential ‘Pp. Because of the rigidity of the cell wall, the cell does not rupture. This turgor pressure is ultimately responsible for enlargement and extension growth of cells. What would be the WP of a flaccid cell?

To summarise the discussion so far, simple harmonic motion can be defined in two equivalent ways, either by Eq. (14.4) for displacement or by Eq. (14. 13) that gives its force law. Going from Eq. (14.4) to Eq. (14.13) required us to differentiate two times. Likewise, by integrating the force law Eq. (14.13) two times, we can get back Eq. (14.4). Note that the force in Eq. (14.13) is linearly proportional to At). A particle oscillating under such a force is, therefore, calling a linear harmonic oscillator. In the real world, the force may contain small additional terms proportional to x2, )8, etc. These then are called non-linear oscillators.

If the surface energy of the film is S per unit area, the extra area is 2dl. A film has two sides and the liquid in between, so there are two surfaces and the extra energy is S (2dl) = Fd (10.21) Or, S=Fd/2dl= F/21 (10.22) This quantity S is the magnitude of surface tension. It is equal to the surface energy per unit area of the liquid interface and is also equal to the force per unit length exerted by the ﬂuid on the movable bar. So far we have talked about the surface of one liquid. More generally, we need to consider ﬂuid surface in contact with other ﬂuids or solid surfaces. The surface energy in that case depends on the materials on both sides of the surface. For example, if the molecules of the materials attract each other, surface energy is reduced while if they repel each other the surface energy is increased. Thus, more appropriately, the surface energy is the energy of the interface between two materials and depends on both of them. We make the following observations from above: (i) Surface tension is a force per unit length (or surface energy per unit area) acting in the plane of the interface between the plane of the liquid and any other substance; it also is the extra energy that the molecules at the interface have as compared to molecules in the interior. (ii) At any point on the interface besides the boundary, we can draw a line and imagine 2019-20 equal and opposite surface tension forces S per unit length of the line acting perpendicular to the line, in the plane of the interface. The line is in equilibrium. To be more specific, imagine a line of atoms or molecules at the surface. The atoms to the left pull the line towards them; those to the right pull it towards them! This line of atoms is in equilibrium under tension. If the line really marks the end of the interface, as in Figure 10.16 (a) and (b) there is only the force S per unit length acting inwards. Table 10.3 gives the surface tension of various liquids. The value of surface tension depends on temperature. Like viscosity, the surface tension of a liquid usually falls with temperature.

physics/,"102 PHYSICS approximately true. Yet they are very useful in practical calculations in mechanics. Thus, when two bodies are in contact, each experiences a contact force by the other. Friction, by deﬁnition, is the component of the contact force parallel to the surfaces in contact, which opposes impending or actual relative motion between the two surfaces. Note that it is not motion, but relative motion that the frictional force opposes. Consider a box lying in the compartment of a train that is accelerating. If the box is stationary relative to the train, it is in fact accelerating along with the train. What forces cause the acceleration of the box? Clearly, the only conceivable force in the horizontal direction is the force of friction. If there were no friction, the ﬂoor of the train would slip by and the box would remain at its initial position due to inertia (and hit the back side of the train). This impending relative motion is opposed by the static friction f8. Static friction provides the same acceleration to the box as that of the train, keeping it stationary relative to the train. b Example 5.7 Determine the maximum acceleration of the train in which a box lying on its ﬂoor will remain stationary. given that the co—efficient of static friction between the box and the train‘s ﬂoor is 0.15.

What is the coefficient of static friction between the block and the surface '? Fig. 5.11 2019-20 Answer The forces acting on a block of mass m at rest on an inclined plane are (i) the weight mg acting vertically downwards (ii) the normal force N of the plane on the block, and (iii) the static frictional force f5 opposing the impending motion. In equilibrium, the resultant of these forces must be zero. Resolving the weight mg along the two directions shown, we have mgsin0=fs, mg cos0 = N As 0 increases, the self-adjusting frictional force f5 increases until at 6 = 0m, fS achieves its maximum value, (f5 )max = us N. Therefore, tan em = us or em = tan’1 us When 0 becomes just a little more than 6m , there is a small net force on the block and it begins to slide.

physics/,"LAWS OF MOTION lOl since we are talking of uncharged and non- magnetic bodies in mechanics. At the microscopic level, all bodies are made of charged constituents (nuclei and electrons) and the various contact forces arising due to elasticity of bodies, molecular collisions and impacts, etc. can ultimately be traced to the electrical forces between the charged constituents of different bodies. The detailed microscopic origin of these forces is, however, complex and not useful for handling problems in mechanics at the macroscopic scale. This is why they are treated as different types of forces with their characteristic properties determined empirically. 5.9. 1 Friction Let us return to the example of a body of mass m at rest on a horizontal table. The force of gravity (mg) is cancelled by the normal reaction force (N) of the table. Now suppose a force Fis applied horizontally to the body. We know from experience that a small applied force may not be enough to move the body. But if the applied force Fwere the only external force on the body, it must move with acceleration F/ m, however small. Clearly, the body remains at rest because some other force comes into play in the horizontal direction and opposes the applied force F, resulting in zero net force on the body. This force fS parallel to the surface of the body in contact with the table is known as frictional force, or simply friction (Fig. 5.10(a)). The subscript stands for static friction to distinguish it from kinetic friction fk that we consider later (Fig. 5.10(b)). Note that static friction does not (a) (b) Fig. 5.10 Static and sliding friction: (a) Impending motion of the body is opposed by static friction. When external force exceeds the maximum limit of static friction, the body begins to move. (b) Once the body is in motion, it is subject to sliding or kinetic friction which opposes relative motion between the two surfaces in contact. Kinetic friction is usually less than the maximum value of static friction. exist by itself. When there is no applied force, there is no static friction. It comes into play the moment there is an applied force. As the applied force F increases, fS also increases, remaining equal and opposite to the applied force (up to a certain limit), keeping the body at rest. Hence, it is called static friction. Static friction opposes impending motion. The term impending motion means motion that would take place (but does not actually take place) under the applied force, if friction were absent. We know from experience that as the applied force exceeds a certain limit, the body begins to move. It is found experimentally that the limiting value of static friction (f5 )max is independent of the area of contact and varies with the normal force (N) approximately as : (fs )m = MN (513) where us is a constant of proportionality depending only on the nature of the surfaces in contact. The constant [.15 is called the coefficient of static friction. The law of static friction may thus be written as fs 3 [.15 N (5.14) If the applied force F exceeds (f5 )max the body begins to slide on the surface. It is found experimentally that when relative motion has started, the frictional force decreases from the static maximum value (fs )max . Frictional force that opposes relative motion between surfaces in contact is called kinetic or sliding friction and is denoted by fk . Kinetic friction, like static friction, is found to be independent of the area of contact. Further, it is nearly independent of the velocity. It satisfies a law similar to that for static friction: fk 2 #kN (5.15) where pk the coefficient of kinetic friction, depends only on the surfaces in contact. As mentioned above, experiments show that pk is less than [.15. When relative motion has begun, the acceleration of the body according to the second law is ( F —fk )/ m. For a body moving with constant velocity, F =fk. If the applied force on the body is removed, its acceleration is — fk / m and it eventually comes to a stop. The laws of friction given above do not have the status of fundamental laws like those for gravitational, electric and magnetic forces. They are empirical relations that are only 2019-20"

Have you ever wondered from where plants get their food? Green plants, in fact, have to make or rather synthesise the food they need and all other organisms depend on them for their needs. The green plants make or rather synthesise the food they need through photosynthesis and are therefore called autotrophs. You have already learnt that the autotrophic nutrition is found only in plants and all other organisms that depend on the green plants for food are heterotrophs. Green plants carry out ‘photosynthesis’, a physico-chemical process by which they use light energy to drive the synthesis of organic compounds. Ultimately, all living forms on earth depend on sunlight for energy. The use of energy from sunlight by plants doing photosynthesis is the basis of life on earth. Photosynthesis is important due to two reasons: it is the primary source of all food on earth. It is also responsible for the release of oxygen into the atmosphere by green plants. Have you ever thought what would happen if there were no oxygen to breath? This chapter focusses on the structure of the photosynthetic machinery and the various reactions that transform light energy into chemical energy. 13.1 WHAT DO WE KNOW? Let us try to ﬁnd out what we already know about photosynthesis. Some simple experiments you may have done in the earlier classes have shown that chlorophyll (green pigment of the leaf), light and CO2 are required for photosynthesis to occur. You may have carried out the experiment to look for starch formation in two leaves — a variegated leaf or a leaf that was partially covered with black paper, and exposed to light. On testing these leaves for the presence of starch it was clear that photosynthesis occurred only in the green parts of the leaves in the presence of light. 2019-2020"

Bicycling 500 That is not to say that mechanical work cannot be estimated in Heart beat 12 ordinary human activity. Consider a person walking with constant speed we. The mechanical work he does may be estimated simply with the help of the work—energy theorem. Assume : (a) The major work done in walking is due to the acceleration and deceleration of the legs with each stride [See Fig. 6.20). [b] Neglect air resistance. [c] Neglect the small work done in lifting the legs against gravity. [d] Neglect the swinging of hands etc. as is common in walking. As we can see in Fig. 6.20, in each stride the leg is brought from rest to a speed, approximately equal to the speed of walking, and then brought to rest again. 4—1 stride -—> Fig. 6.20 An illustration of a single stride in walking. While the ﬁrst leg is maximally off the round, the second leg is on the ground and vice-versa The work done by one leg in each stride is ml [)3 by the work—energy theorem. Here ml is the mass of the leg. Note ml vg/Z energy is expended by one set of leg muscles to bring the foot from rest to speed v0 while an additional ml v3 /2 is expended by a complementary set of leg muscles to bring the foot to rest from speed v0. Hence work done by both legs in one stride is (study Fig. 6.20 carefully) WS=2ml mg [6.34) Assuming mass of the leg ml: 10 kg and slow running with a speed of 10 km in a hour which translates to approximately 3 m s‘l, we obtain WS 2 180 J / stride If we take a stride to be 2 m long, the person covers 1.5 strides per second at his speed of 3 m s‘l. Thus the power expended P=180 J x1.5 snide stride second = 270 W We must bear in mind that this is a lower estimate since several avenues of power loss [e.g. swinging of hands, air resistance etc.) have been ignored. The interesting point is that we did not worry about the forces involved. The forces, mainly friction and those exerted on the leg by the muscles of the rest of the body, are hard to estimate. Static friction does no work and we bypassed the impossible task of estimating the work done by the muscles by taking recourse to the work—energy theorem. We can also see the advantage of a wheel. The wheel permits smooth locomotion without the continual starting and stopping in mammalian locomotion. 2019-20"

Since 1 and 2 refer to any two locations along the pipeline, we may write the expression in general as E 1 P+ ( )pv2 + pgh = constant (10.13) Fig. 10.9 The ﬂow of an ideal ﬂuid in a pipe of varying cross section. The ﬂuid in a section of length v 1At moves to the section of length vZAt in time At. In words, the Bernoulli’s relation may be stated as follows: As we move along a streamline the sum of the pressure (P), the kinetic energy pv2 per unit volume [ 2 j and the potential energy per unit volume (p gh) remains a constant. Note that in applying the energy conservation principle, there is an assumption that no energy is lost due to friction. But in fact, when ﬂuids ﬂow. some energy does get lost due to internal friction. This arises due to the fact that in a ﬂuid ﬂow, the different layers of the ﬂuid ﬂow with different velocities. These layers exert frictional forces on each other resulting in a loss of energy. This property of the ﬂuid is called viscosity and is discussed in more detail in a later section. The lost kinetic energy of the ﬂuid gets converted into heat energy. Thus, Bernoulli’s equation ideally applies to ﬂuids with zero viscosity or non-viscous ﬂuids. Another restriction on application of Bernoulli theorem is that the ﬂuids must be incompressible, as the elastic energy of the ﬂuid is also not taken into consideration. In practice, it has a large number of useful applications and can help explain a wide variety of phenomena for low viscosity incompressible ﬂuids. Bernoulli’s equation also does not hold for non-steady or turbulent ﬂows, because in that situation velocity and pressure are constantly ﬂuctuating in time. When a ﬂuid is at rest i.e., its velocity is zero everywhere, Bernoulli’s equation becomes P1+ pgh1= P2 + pgh. (Pl—P2) = pg (’12—’11) which is same as Eq. (10.6). 10.4.1 Speed of Efﬂux: Torricelli's Law The word efﬂux means ﬂuid outﬂow. Torricelli discovered that the speed of efﬂux from an open tank is given by a formula identical to that of a freely falling body. Consider a tank containing a liquid of density p with a small hole in its side at a height yl from the bottom (see Fig. 10.10). The air above the liquid, whose surface is at height y2. is at pressure P. From the equation of continuity [Eq. (10. 10)] we have v1A1=v2A2 A1 v 2—D 2 A2 1 Fig. 10.10 Torricelli’s law.

It consists of one large and shield shaped cotyledon known as scutellum and a short axis with a plumule and a radicle. The plumule and radicle are enclosed in sheaths which are called coleoptile and coleorhiza respectively (Figure 5.19).

It is convenient to look at the motion of the crest of the wave. Fig. 15.8 gives the shape of the wave at two instants of time, which differ by a small time internal At. The entire wave pattern is seen to shift to the right (positive direction of x—aXis) by a distance Ax. In particular, the crest shown by a clot (0) moves a y Ax “At H —> t Fig. 1 5.8 Progression of a harmonic wave from time t to t + At. where At is a small interval. The wave pattern as a whole shifts to the right. The crest of the wave (or a point with any ﬁxed phase) moves right by the distance Ax in time At. distance Ax in time At. The speed of the wave is then Ax/At. We can put the clot (c) on a point with any other phase. It will move with the same speed v (otherwise the wave pattern will not remain fixed). The motion of a fixed phase point on the wave is given by kx — (at = constant (15.10) Thus, as time t changes, the position x of the fixed phase point must change so that the phase remains constant. Thus, kx — cat = k(x+Ax) — w(t+A t) or k Ax — coAt =0 Taking Ax, Atvanishingly small, this gives £2 2: D (15.11) dt k Relating a) to Tand k to 7t, we get v:2_7w:gv:i 2W)» T (15.12) Eq.

physics/,"MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 277 — maximum as the blood is pumped by the heart (systolic pressure) and a minimum as the heart relaxes (diastolic pressure). The sphygmomanometer is a device, which measures these extreme pressures. It works on the principle that blood ﬂow in the brachial (upper arm) artery can be made to go from laminar to turbulent by suitable compression. Turbulent ﬂow is dissipative, and its sound can be picked up on the stethoscope. The gauge pressure in an air sack wrapped around the upper arm is measured using a manometer or a dial pressure gauge (Fig. 10.27). The pressure in the sack is first increased till the brachial artery is closed. The pressure in the sack is then slowly reduced while a stethoscope placed just below the sack is used to listen to noises arising in the brachial artery. When the pressure is just below the systolic (peak) pressure, the artery opens brieﬂy. During this brief Air sack period, the blood velocity in the highly constricted Stethoscope\ artery is high and turbulent and hence noisy. The resulting noise is heard as a tapping sound on the stethoscope. When the pressure in the sack is lowered further, the artery remains open for a longer portion of the heart cycle. Nevertheless, it remains closed during the diastolic (minimum pressure) phase of the heartbeat. Thus the duration of the tapping sound is longer. When the pressure in the sack reaches the diastolic pressure the artery is open during the entire heart cycle. The ﬂow is however, still turbulent and noisy. But instead of a tapping sound we hear a steady, continuous roar on the stethoscope. Fig. 1 0.27 Blood pressure measurement using the sphygmomanometer and stethoscope. The blood pressure of a patient is presented as the ratio of systolic / diastolic pressures. For a resting healthy adult it is typically 120/80 mm of Hg (120/80 torr). Pressures above 140/90 require medical attention and advice. High blood pressures may seriously damage the heart, kidney and other organs and must be controlled. 2019-20"

biology/,"ANIMAL KINGDOM Echinoderms and Chordates, organs have associated to form functional systems, each system concerned with a speciﬁc physiological function. This pattern is called organ system level of organisation. Organ systems in different groups of animals exhibit various patterns of complexities. For example, the digestive system in Platyhelminthes has only a single opening to the outside of the body that serves as both mouth and anus, and is hence called incomplete. A complete digestive system has two openings, mouth and anus. Similarly, the circulatory system may be of two types: (i) open type in which the blood is pumped out of the heart and the cells and tissues are directly bathed in it and (ii) closed type in which the blood is circulated through a series of vessels of valying diameters (arteries, veins and capillaries). 4. 1 .2 Symmetry Animals can be categorised on the basis of their symmetry. Sponges are mostly asymmetrical, i.e., any plane that passes through the centre does not divide them into equal halves. When any plane passing through the central axis of the body divides the organism into two identical halves, it is called radial symmetry. Coelenterates, ctenophores and echinoderms have this kind of body plan (Figure 4. 1a). Animals like annelids, arthropods, etc., where the body can be divided into identical left and right halves in only one plane, exhibit bilateral symmetry (Figure 4.1b). 4.1.3 Diploblastic and Triploblastic Organisation Animals in which the cells are arranged in two embryonic layers, an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm, are called diploblastic animals, e.g., coelenterates.

geography/,"MOVEMENTS OF OCEAN WATER wave moves to a new position (Figure 14.1). The actual motion of the water beneath the waves is circular. It indicates that things are carried up and forward as the wave approaches, and down and back as it passes. Characteristics of Waves Wave crest and trough : The highest and lowest points of a wave are called the crest and trough respectively. Wave height : It is the vertical distance from the bottom of a trough to the top of a crest of a wave. Wave amplitude : It is one-half of the wave height. Wave period: It is merely the time interval between two successive wave crests or troughs as they pass a fixed point. Wavelength: It is the horizontal distance between two successive crests. Wave speed : It is the rate at which the wave moves through the water, and is measured in knots. Wave jrequency : It is the number of waves passing a given point during a one- second time interval. TIDEs The periodical rise and fall of the sea level, once or twice a day, mainly due to the attraction of the sun and the moon, is called a tide. Movement of water caused by meteorological effects (winds and atmospheric pressure changes) are called surges. Surges are not regular like tides. The study of tides is very complex, spatially and temporally, as it has great variations in frequency, magnitude and height. The moon’s gravitational pull to a great extent and to a lesser extent the sun’s gravitational pull, are the major causes for the occurrence of tides. Another factor is centrifugal force, which is the force that acts to counter balance the gravity. Together, the gravitational pull and the centrifugal force are responsible for creating the two major tidal bulges on the earth. On the side of the earth facing the moon, a tidal bulge occurs while on the opposite side though the gravitational attraction of the moon 117 is less as it is farther away, the centrifugal force causes tidal bulge on the other side (Figure 1 4. 2) . The ‘tide-generating’ force is the difference between these two forces; i.e. the gravitational attraction of the moon and the centrifugal force. On the surface of the earth, nearest the moon, pull or the attractive force of the moon is greater than the centrifugal force, and so there is a net force causing a bulge towards the moon. On the opposite side of the earth, the attractive force is less, as it is farther away from the moon, the centrifugal force is dominant. Hence, there is a net force away from the moon. It creates the second bulge away from the moon. On the surface of the earth, the horizontal tide generating forces are more important than the vertical forces in generating the tidal bulges.

Funnel-shaped bays greatly change tidal magnitudes. When the tide is channelled between islands or into bays and estuaries they are called tidal currents. 2019-2020"

The surface has been considered to possess negligible friction. 4 We conclude this section by making a few remarks on conservative forces. (i) Information on time is absent from the above discussions. In the example considered above, we can calculate the compression, but not the time over which the compression occurs. A solution of Newton’s Second Law for this system is required for temporal information. (ii) Not all forces are conservative. Friction, for example, is a non-conservative force. The principle of conservation of energy will have to be modified in this case. This is illustrated in Example 6.9. (iii) The zero of the potential energy is arbitrary. It is set according to convenience. For the spring force we took V(x) = O, at x = O, i.e. the unstretched spring had zero potential energy. For the constant gravitational force mg, we took V= O on the earth’s surface. In a later chapter we shall see that for the force due to the universal law of gravitation, the zero is best defined at an infinite distance from the gravitational source. However, once the zero of the potential energy is fixed in a given discussion, it must be consistently adhered to throughout the discussion. You cannot change horses in midstream ! > Example 6.9 Consider Example 6.8 taking the coefﬁcient of friction. u. to be 0.5 and calculate the maximum compression of the spring. Answer In presence of friction, both the spring force and the frictional force act so as to oppose the compression of the spring as shown in Fig. 6.9. We invoke the work-energy theorem, rather than the conservation of mechanical energy. The change in kinetic energy is l equilibrium my position Fig. 6.9 The forces acting on the car.

Putting in numerical values we obtain X x = 1.35m which, as expected, is less than the result in Example 6.8. If the two forces on the body consist of a conservative force FC and a non-conservative force FnC , the conservation of mechanical energy formula will have to be modified.

biology/,"THE LIVING WORLD providing scientiﬁc names better. The scientiﬁc name of mango is written as Mangifera indica. Let us see how it is a binomial name. In this name Mangifera represents the genus while indica, is a particular species, or a speciﬁc epithet. Other universal rules of nomenclature are as follows: 1. Biological names are generally in Latin and written in italics. They are Latinised or derived from Latin irrespective of their origin. 2. The ﬁrst word in a biological name represents the genus while the second component denotes the speciﬁc epithet. 3. Both the words in a biological name, when handwritten, are separately underlined, or printed in italics to indicate their Latin origin. 4. The ﬁrst word denoting the genus starts with a capital letter while the speciﬁc epithet starts with a small letter. It can be illustrated with the example of Mangifera indica. Name of the author appears after the speciﬁc epithet, i.e., at the end of the biological name and is written in an abbreviated form, e. g., Mangﬁera indica Linn. It indicates that this species was ﬁrst described by Linnaeus. Since it is nearly impossible to study all the living organisms, it is necessary to devise some means to make this possible. This process is classiﬁcation. Classiﬁcation is the process by which anything is grouped into convenient categories based on some easily observable characters. For example, we easily recognise groups such as plants or animals or dogs, cats or insects. The moment we use any of these terms, we associate certain characters with the organism in that group. What image do you see when you think of a dog ? Obviously, each one of us will see ‘dogs’ and not ‘cats’. Now, if we were to think of ‘Alsatians’ we know what we are talking about. Similarly, suppose we were to say ‘mammals’, you would, of course, think of animals with external ears and body hair. Likewise, in plants, if we try to talk of ‘Wheat’, the picture in each of our minds will be of wheat plants, not of rice or any other plant. Hence, all these - ‘Dogs’, ‘Cats’, ‘Mammals’, ‘Wheat’, ‘Rice’, ‘Plants’, ‘Animals’, etc., are convenient categories we use to study organisms. The scientiﬁc term for these categories is taxa. Here you must recognise that taxa can indicate categories at very different levels. ‘Plants’ — also form a taxa. ‘Wheat’ is also a taxa. Similarly, ‘animals’, ‘mammals’, ‘dogs’ are all taxa — but you know that a dog is a mammal and mammals are animals. Therefore, ‘animals’, ‘mammals’ and ‘dogs’ represent taxa at different levels. Hence, based on characteristics, all living organisms can be classiﬁed into different taxa. This process of classiﬁcation is taxonomy.

Gastric glands have three major types of cells namely - (i) mucus neck cells which secrete mucus; (ii) peptic or chief cells which secrete the proenzyme pepsinogen; and (iii) parietal or oxyntic cells which secrete HCl and intrinsic factor (factor essential for absorption of vitamin B12). ,— y ‘7’ .v , f: .2 ‘ ‘l ‘ z.. z .‘ {Swimsus—r-Ee- , , , . . ’7-0 .1_ The stomach stores the food for 4-5 hours. The food mixes thoroughly with the acidic gastric juice of the stomach by the churning movements of its muscular wall and is called the chyme. ’Ihe proenzyme pepsinogen, on exposure to hydrochloric acid gets converted into the active enzyme pepsin, the proteolytic enzyme of the stomach. Pepsin converts proteins into proteoses and peptones (peptides). The mucus and bicarbonates present in the gastric juice play an important role in lubrication and protection of the mucosal epithelium from excoriation by the highly concentrated hydrochloric acid. HCl provides the acidic pH (pH 1.8) optimal for pepsins. Rennin is a proteolytic enzyme found in gastric juice of infants which helps in the digestion of milk proteins. Small amounts of lipases are also secreted by gastric glands. Various types of movements are generated by the muscularis layer of the small intestine. These movements help in a thorough mixing up of the food with various secretions in the intestine and thereby facilitate digestion. The bile, pancreatic juice and the intestinal juice are the secretions released into the small intestine. Pancreatic juice and bile are released through the hepato-pancreatic duct. The pancreatic juice contains inactive enzymes — trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, procarboxypeptidases, amylases, lipases and nucleases. Trypsinogen is activated by an enzyme, enterokinase, secreted by the intestinal mucosa into active trypsin, which in turn activates the other enzymes in the pancreatic juice. The bile released into the duodenum contains bile pigments (bilirubin and bili-verdin), bile salts, cholesterol and phospholipids but no enzymes. Bile helps in emulsiﬁcation of fats, i.e., breaking down of the fats into very small micelles. Bile also activates lipases. The intestinal mucosal epithelium has goblet cells which secrete mucus. The secretions of the brush border cells of the mucosa alongwith the secretions of the goblet cells constitute the intestinal juice or succus entericus. This juice contains a variety of enzymes like disaccharidases (e. g., maltase), dipeptidases, lipases, nucleosidases, etc. The mucus alongwith the bicarbonates from the pancreas protects the intestinal mucosa from acid as well as provide an alkaline medium (pH 7 .8) for enzymatic activities. Sub-mucosal glands (Brunner’s glands) also help in this."
physics/,"l84 PHYSICS Copernicus (1473-1543) proposed a deﬁnitive model in which the planets moved in circles around a fixed central sun. His theory was discredited by the church, but notable amongst its supporters was Galileo who had to face prosecution from the state for his beliefs. It was around the same time as Galileo, a nobleman called Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) hailing from Denmark, spent his entire lifetime recording observations of the planets with the naked eye. His compiled data were analysed later by his assistant Johannes Kepler (157 l- 1640). He could extract from the data three elegant laws that now go by the name of Kepler’s laws. These laws were known to Newton and enabled him to make a great scientific leap in proposing his universal law of gravitation. 8.2 KEPLER'S LAWS The three laws of Kepler can be stated as follows: 1. Law of orbits : All planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun situated at one of the foci Fig. 8.1(a) An ellipse traced out by a planet around the sun. The closest point is P and the farthest point is A, P is called the perihelion and A the aphelion. The semimajor axis is half the distance AP. Fig. 8.1(b) Drawing an ellipse. A string has its ends ﬁxed at F1 and F2. The tip of a pencil holds the string taut and is moved around. * Refer to information given in the Box on Page 182 2019-20 of the ellipse (Fig. 8.1a). This law was a deviation from the Copernican model which allowed only circular orbits. The ellipse, of which the circle is a special case, is a closed curve which can be drawn very simply as follows. Select two points F1 and F2. Take a length of a string and fix its ends at F1 and F2 by pins. With the tip of a pencil stretch the string taut and then draw a curve by moving the pencil keeping the string taut throughout.(Fig. 8.1(b)) The closed curve you get is called an ellipse. Clearly for any point T on the ellipse, the sum of the distances from F1 and F2 is a constant. F1, F2 are called the focii. Join the points F1 and F2 and extend the line to intersect the ellipse at points P and A as shown in Fig. 8.1(b). The midpoint of the line PA is the centre of the ellipse O and the length P0 = A0 is called the semi- major axis of the ellipse. For a circle, the two focii merge into one and the semi-major axis becomes the radius of the circle. 2. Law of areas : The line that joins any planet to the sun sweeps equal areas in equal intervals of time (Fig. 8.2). This law comes from the observations that planets appear to move slower when they are farther from the sun than when they are nearer. p (Planet) Fig. 8.2 The planet P moves around the sun in an elliptical orbit. The shaded area is the area AA swept out in a small interval of time At. 3. Law of periods : The square of the time period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the ellipse traced out by the planet. Table 8.1 gives the approximate time periods of revolution of eight* planets around the sun along with values of their semi-major axes."
physics/,"350 PHYSICS Fig. 14.14 Answer Let the mass be displaced by a small distance x to the right side of the equilibrium position, as shown in Fig. 14.15. Under this situation the spring on the left side gets Fig. 14.15 elongated by a length equal to x and that on the right side gets compressed by the same length. The forces acting on the mass are then, F1 = —kx (force exerted by the spring on the left side, trying to pull the mass towards the mean position) F2 = —kx (force exerted by the spring on the right side, trying to push the mass towards the mean position) The net force, F, acting on the mass is then given by, F =—2kx Hence the force acting on the mass is proportional to the displacement and is directed towards the mean position; therefore, the motion executed by the mass is simple harmonic.

In section 14.5 we have seen that the velocity of a particle executing SHM, is a periodic function of time. It is zero at the extreme positions of displacement. Therefore, the kinetic energy (K) of such a particle, which is defined as K=lmv2 2 = g m (02A2 sin2(a)t + ¢) =ékA2sin2(wt+¢) (14.15) is also a periodic function of time, being zero when the displacement is maximum and maximum when the particle is at the mean position. Note, since the sign of v is immaterial in K, the period of K is T/ 2. What is the potential energy (U) of a particle executing simple harmonic motion? In Chapter 6, we have seen that the concept of potential energy is possible only for conservative forces. The spring force F = —kx is a conservative force, with associated potential energy 1 U=§kx2 (14.16) Hence the potential energy of a particle executing simple harmonic motion is, U(x) = l kx2 2 =ékA2c052(a)t+¢) (14.17) Thus, the potential energy of a particle executing simple harmonic motion is also periodic, with period T/ 2, being zero at the mean position and maximum at the extreme displacements."
biology/,"BIOLOGY process and ecological information of organisms are essential and form the basis of modern taxonomic studies. Hence, characterisation, identiﬁcation, classiﬁcation and nomenclature are the processes that are basic to taxonomy. Taxonomy is not something new. Human beings have always been interested in knowing more and more about the various kinds of organisms, particularly with reference to their own use. In early days, human beings needed to ﬁnd sources for their basic needs of food, clothing and shelter. Hence, the earliest classiﬁcations were based on the ‘uses’ of various organisms. Human beings were, since long, not only interested in knowing more about different kinds of organisms and their diversities, but also the relationships among them. This branch of study was referred to as systematics. The word systematics is derived from the Latin word ‘systema’ which means systematic arrangement of organisms. Linnaeus used Systema Naturae as the title of his publication. The scope of systematics was later enlarged to include identiﬁcation, nomenclature and classification. Systematics takes into account evolutionary relationships between organisms. 1 .3 TAXONOMIC CATEGORIES Classiﬁcation is not a single step process but involves hierarchy of steps in which each step represents a rank or category. Since the category is a part of overall taxonomic arrangement, it is called the taxonomic category and all categories together constitute the taxonomic hierarchy. Each category, referred to as a unit of classiﬁcation, in fact, represents a rank and is commonly termed as taxon (pl.: taxa). Taxonomic categories and hierarchy can be illustrated by an example. Insects represent a group of organisms sharing common features like three pairs of jointed legs. It means insects are recognisable concrete objects which can be classiﬁed, and thus were given a rank or category. Can you name other such groups of organisms? Remember, groups represent category. Category further denotes rank. Each rank or taxon, in fact, represents a unit of classiﬁcation. These taxonomic groups/ categories are distinct biological entities and not merely morphological aggregates. Taxonomical studies of all known organisms have led to the development of common categories such as kingdom, phylum or division (for plants), class, order, family, genus and species. All organisms, including those in the plant and animal kingdoms have species as the lowest category. Now the question you may ask is, how to place an"

biology/,"BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 2.2.2 Dinoﬂagellates These organisms are mostly marine and photosynthetic. They appear yellow, green, brown, blue or red depending on the main pigments present in their cells. The cell wall has stiff cellulose plates on the outer surface. Most of them have two ﬂagella; one lies longitudinally and the other transversely in a furrow between the wall plates. Very often, red dinoﬂagellates (Example: Gonyaulax) undergo such rapid multiplication that they make the sea appear red (red tides). Toxins released by such large numbers may even kill other marine animals such as ﬁshes. 2.2.3 Euglenoids Majority of them are fresh water organisms found in stagnant water. Instead of a cell wall, they have a protein rich layer called pellicle which makes their body ﬂexible. They have two ﬂagella, a short and a long one. Though they are photosynthetic in the presence of sunlight, when deprived of sunlight they behave like heterotrophs by predating on other smaller organisms. Interestingly, the pigments of euglenoids are identical to those present in higher plants. Example: Euglena Wigure 2.4a). 2.2.4 Slime Moulds Slime moulds are saprophytic protists. The body moves along decaying twigs and leaves engulfing organic material. Under suitable conditions, they form an aggregation called plasmodium which may grow and spread over several feet. During unfavourable conditions, the plasmodium differentiates and forms fruiting bodies bearing spores at their tips. The spores possess true walls. They are extremely resistant and survive for many years, even under adverse conditions. The spores are dispersed by air currents. 2.2.5 Protozoans All protozoans are heterotrophs and live as predators or parasites. They are believed to be primitive relatives of animals. There are four major groups of protozoans. Amoeboid protozoans: These organisms live in fresh water, sea water or moist soil.

biology/,"THE LIVING WORLD unicellular or multicellular. All plants, animals, fungi and microbes exhibit metabolism. The sum total of all the chemical reactions occurring in our body is metabolism. No non-living object exhibits metabolism. Metabolic reactions can be demonstrated outside the body in cell-free systems. An isolated metabolic reaction(s) outside the body of an organism, performed in a test tube is neither living nor non-living. Hence, while metabolism is a defining feature of all living organisms without exception, isolated metabolic reactions in vitro are not living things but surely living reactions. Hence, cellular organisation of the body is the deﬁning feature of life forms. Perhaps, the most obvious and technically complicated feature of all living organisms is this ability to sense their surroundings or environment and respond to these environmental stimuli which could be physical, chemical or biological. We sense our environment through our sense organs. Plants respond to external factors like light, water, temperature, other organisms, pollutants, etc. All organisms, from the prokaryotes to the most complex eukaryotes can sense and respond to environmental cues. Photoperiod affects reproduction in seasonal breeders, both plants and animals. All organisms handle chemicals entering their bodies. All organisms therefore, are ‘aware’ of their surroundings. Human being is the only organism who is aware of himself, i.e., has self-consciousness. Consciousness therefore, becomes the deﬁning property of living organisms. When it comes to human beings, it is all the more difficult to deﬁne the living state. We observe patients lying in coma in hospitals virtually supported by machines which replace heart and lungs. The patient is otherwise brain-dead. The patient has no self-consciousness. Are such patients who never come back to normal life, living or non-living? In higher classes, you will come to know that all living phenomena are due to underlying interactions. Properties of tissues are not present in the constituent cells but arise as a result of interactions among the constituent cells. Similarly, properties of cellular organelles are not present in the molecular constituents of the organelle but arise as a result of interactions among the molecular components comprising the organelle. These interactions result in emergent properties at a higher level of organisation. This phenomenon is true in the hierarchy of organisational complexity at all levels. Therefore, we can say that living organisms are self-replicating, evolving and self-regulating interactive systems capable of responding to external stimuli. Biologr is the story of life on earth. Biology is the story of evolution of living organisms on earth. All living organisms — present, past and future, are linked to one another by the sharing of the common genetic material, but to varying degrees."

While the WE theorem is useful in a variety of problems, it does not, in general, incorporate the complete dynamical information of Newton’s second law. It is an integral form of Newton’s second law. Newton’s second law is a relation between acceleration and force at any instant of time. Work-energy theorem involves an integral over an interval of time. In this sense, the temporal (time) information contained in the statement of Newton’s second law is ‘integrated over’ and is 2019-20"

The acceleration is directed, at each point of the path, towards the centre of the circle. Let r and r’ be the position vectors and v and v’ the velocities of the object when it is at point P and P’ as shown in Fig. 4.19(a). By definition, velocity at a point is along the tangent at that point in the direction of motion. The velocity vectors v and v’ are as shown in Fig. 4.19(a1). Av is obtained in Fig. 4. 19 (a2) using the triangle law of vector addition. Since the path is circular, v is perpendicular to r and so is v’ to r’. Therefore, Av is perpendicular to Ar. Since A I average acceleration is along Av L5 : —VJ, the At average acceleration E is perpendicular to Ar. If we place Av on the line that bisects the angle between 1' and 1"" , we see that it is directed towards the centre of the circle. Figure 4.19(b) shows the same quantities for smaller time interval. Av and hence E is again directed towards the centre. In Fig. 4.19(c), At-> O and the average acceleration becomes the instantaneous acceleration. It is directed towards the centre*.

Our vertebral column (Figure 20.7) is formed by 26 serially arranged units called vertebrae and is dorsally placed. It extends from the base of the skull and constitutes the main framework of the trunk. Each vertebra has a central hollow portion (neural canal) through which the spinal cord passes. First vertebra is the atlas and it articulates with the occipital condyles. The vertebral column is differentiated into cervical (7), thoracic (12), lumbar (5), sacral (1 -fused) and coccygeal (l-fused) regions starting from the skull. The number of cervical vertebrae are seven in almost all mammals including human beings. The vertebral column protects the spinal cord, supports the head and serves as the point of attachment for the ribs and musculature of the back. Sternum is a ﬂat bone on the ventral midline of thorax. There are 12 pairs of ribs. Each rib is a thin ﬂat bone connected dorsally to the vertebral column and ventrally to the sternum. It has two articulation surfaces on its dorsal end and is hence called bicephalic. First seven pairs of ribs are called true ribs. Dorsally, they are attached to the thoracic vertebrae and ventrally connected to the sternum with the help of hyaline cartilage. The 8th, 9th and 10th pairs of ribs do not articulate directly with the sternum but join the seventh rib with the help of hyaline cartilage. These are called vertebrochondral (false) ribs.

geography/,"MOVEMENTS OF OCEAN WATER desilting the sediments and in removing polluted water from river estuaries. Tides are used to generate electrical power (in Canada, France, Russia, and China). A 3 MW tidal power project at Durgaduani in Sunderbans of West Bengal is under way. OCEAN CURRENTS Ocean currents are like river ﬂow in oceans. They represent a regular volume of water in a definite path and direction. Ocean currents are inﬂuenced by two types of forces namely : (i) primary forces that initiate the movement of water; (ii) secondary forces that inﬂuence the currents to ﬂow. The primary forces that inﬂuence the currents are: (i) heating by solar energy; (ii) wind; (iii) gravity; (iv) coriolis force. Heating by solar energy causes the water to expand. That is why, near the equator the ocean water is about 8 cm higher in level than in the middle latitudes. This causes a very slight gradient and water tends to ﬂow down the slope. Wind blowing on the surface of the ocean pushes the water to move. Friction between the wind and the water surface affects the movement of the water body in its course. Gravity tends to pull the water down the pile and create gradient variation. The Coriolis force intervenes and causes the water to move to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. These large accumulations of water and the ﬂow around them are called Gyres. These produce large circular currents in all the ocean basins. Characteristics of Ocean Currents Currents are referred to by their “drift”. Usually, the currents are strongest near the surface and may attain speeds over five knots. At depths, currents are generally slow with speeds less than 0.5 knots. We refer to the speed of a current as its “drift.” Drift is measured in terms of knots. The strength of a current refers to the speed of the current. A fast current is considered strong. A current is usually strongest at the surface and decreases in strength (speed) with depth. Most currents have speeds less than or equal to 5 knots. 119 Differences in water density affect vertical mobility of ocean currents. Water with high salinity is denser than water with low salinity and in the same way cold water is denser than warm water. Denser water tends to sink, while relatively lighter water tends to rise. Cold-water ocean currents occur when the cold water at the poles sinks and slowly moves towards the equator. Warm-water currents travel out from the equator along the surface, ﬂowing towards the poles to replace the sinking cold water. Types of Ocean Currents The ocean currents may be classified based on their depth as surface currents and deep water currents : (i) surface currents constitute about 10 per cent of all the water in the ocean, these waters are the upper 400 m of the ocean; (ii) deep water currents make up the other 90 per cent of the ocean water. These waters move around the ocean basins due to variations in the density and gravity. Deep waters sink into the deep ocean basins at high latitudes, where the temperatures are cold enough to cause the density to increase. Ocean currents can also be classified based on temperature : as cold currents and warm currents: (i) cold currents bring cold water into warm water areas. These currents are usually found on the west coast of the continents in the low and middle latitudes (true in both hemispheres) and on the east coast in the higher latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere; (ii) warm currents bring warm water into cold water areas and are usually observed on the east coast of continents in the low and middle latitudes (true in both hemispheres). In the northern hemisphere they are found on the west coasts of continents in high latitudes. Major Ocean Currents Maj or ocean currents are greatly inﬂuenced by the stresses exerted by the prevailing winds and coriolis force. The oceanic circulation pattern roughly corresponds to the earth’s atmospheric circulation pattern. The air circulation over the oceans in the middle latitudes is mainly anticyclonic (more pronounced in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere). The oceanic circulation pattern also corresponds with the same. At higher latitudes, 2019-2020"

The Carbon Cycle Carbon is one of the basic elements of all living organisms. It forms the basic constituent of all the organic compounds. The biosphere contains over half a million carbon compounds in them. The carbon cycle is mainly the conversion of carbon dioxide. This conversion is initiated by the fixation of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Such conversion results in the production of carbohydrate, glucose that may be converted to other organic compounds such as sucrose, starch, cellulose, etc. Here, some of the carbohydrates are utilised directly by the plant itself. During this process, more carbon dioxide is generated and is released through its leaves or roots during the day. The remaining carbohydrates not being utilised by the plant become part of the plant tissue. Plant tissues are either being eaten by the herbivorous animals or get decomposed by the micro- organisms. The herbivores convert some of the consumed carbohydrates into carbon dioxide for release into the air through respiration.

biology/,"RESPIRATION IN PLANTS directly (herbivores) or indirectly (carnivores). Saprophytes like fungi are dependent on dead and decaying matter. What is important to recognise is that ultimately all the food that is respired for life processes comes from photosynthesis. This chapter deals with cellular respiration or the mechanism of breakdown of food materials within the cell to release energy, and the trapping of this energy for synthesis of ATP. Photosynthesis, of course, takes place within the chloroplasts (in the eukaryotes), whereas the breakdown of complex molecules to yield energy takes place in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria (also only in eukaryotes). The breaking of the C-C bonds of complex compounds through oxidation within the cells, leading to release of considerable amount of energy is called respiration. The compounds that are oxidised during this process are known as respiratory substrates. Usually carbohydrates are oxidised to release energy, but proteins, fats and even organic acids can be used as respiratory substances in some plants, under certain conditions. During oxidation within a cell, all the energy contained in respiratory substrates is not released free into the cell, or in a single step. It is released in a series of slow step-wise reactions controlled by enzymes, and it is trapped as chemical energy in the form of ATP. Hence, it is important to understand that the energy released by oxidation in respiration is not (or rather cannot be) used directly but is used to synthesise ATP, which is broken down whenever (and wherever) energy needs to be utilised. Hence, ATP acts as the energy currency of the cell. This energy trapped in ATP is utilised in various energy-requiring processes of the organisms, and the carbon skeleton produced during respiration is used as precursors for biosynthesis of other molecules in the cell. 14. 1 Do PLANTS BREATHE? Well, the answer to this question is not quite so direct. Yes, plants require 02 for respiration to occur and they also give out C02. Hence, plants have systems in place that ensure the availability of 02. Plants, unlike animals, have no specialised organs for gaseous exchange but they have stomata and lenticels for this purpose. There are several reasons why plants can get along without respiratory organs. First, each plant part takes care of its own gas-exchange needs. There is very little transport of gases from one plant part to another. Second, plants do not present great demands for gas exchange. Roots, stems and leaves respire at rates far lower than animals do. Only during photosynthesis are large volumes of gases exchanged and, each leaf is well adapted to take care of its own needs during these periods. When cells photosynthesise, availability of O2 is not a problem in these cells since 02 is released within the cell. Third, the 227"

These steps are called nitriﬁcation (Figure 12.3). These nitrifying bacteria are chemoautotrophs. The nitrate thus formed is absorbed by plants and is transported to the leaves. In leaves, it is reduced to form ammonia that ﬁnally forms the amine group of amino acids. Nitrate present in the soil is also reduced to nitrogen by the process of denitriﬁcation. Denitriﬁcation is carried by bacteria Pseudomonas and Thiobacillus. 12.6.2 Biological Nitrogen Fixation Very few living organisms can utilise the nitrogen in the form N2, available abundantly in the air.

biology/,"RESPIRATION IN PLANTS produced in the mitochondrial matrix during citric acid cycle are oxidised by an NADH dehydrogenase (complex I), and electrons are then transferred to ubiquinone located Within the inner membrane. Ubiquinone also receives reducing equivalents via FADH2 (complex II) that is generated during oxidation of succinate in the citric acid cycle. The reduced ubiquinone (ubiquinol) is then oxidised with the transfer of electrons to cytochrome 0 via cytochrome bc1 complex (complex III). Cytochrome c is a small protein attached to the outer surface of the inner membrane and acts as a mobile carrier for transfer of electrons between complex III and IV. Complex IV refers to cytochrome c oxidase complex containing cytochromes a and a3, and two copper centres. When the electrons pass from one carrier to another via complex I to IV in the electron transport chain, they are coupled to ATP synthase (complex V) for the production of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. The number of ATP molecules synthesised depends on the nature of the electron donor. Oxidation of one molecule of NADH gives rise to 3 molecules of ATP, While that of one molecule of FADH2 produces 2 molecules of ATP.

geography/,"128 during photosynthesis and is released in the atmosphere through transpiration and respiration processes of plants. The Nitrogen Cycle Nitrogen is a major constituent of the atmosphere comprising about seventy-eight per cent of the atmospheric gases. It is also an essential constituent of different organic compounds such as the amino acids, nucleic acids, proteins, vitamins and pigments. Only a few types of organisms like certain species of soil bacteria and blue green algae are capable of utilising it directly in its gaseous form. Generally, nitrogen is usable only after it is fixed. Ninety per cent of fixed nitrogen is biological. The principal source of free nitrogen is the action of soil micro-organisms and associated plant roots on atmospheric nitrogen found in pore spaces of the soil. Nitrogen can also be fixed in the atmosphere by lightning and cosmic radiation. In the oceans, some marine animals can fix it. After atmospheric nitrogen has been ﬁxed into an available form, green plants can assimilate it. Herbivorous animals feeding on plants, in turn, consume some of it. Dead plants and animals, excretion of nitrogenous wastes are converted into nitrites by the action of bacteria present in the soil. Some bacteria can even convert nitrites into nitrates that can be used again by green plants. There are still other types of bacteria capable of converting nitrates into free nitrogen, a process known as denitriﬁcation (Figure l 5.3). l Atmospheric Nitrogen I l (M “ Atmospheric ‘ Biological , Industrial I Fixation J Fixation ""l Fixation [ Compounds w! Dentriﬁcation Figure 15.3 : Nitrogen Cycle FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY Other Mineral Cycles Other than carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen being the principal geochemical components of the biosphere, many other minerals also occur as critical nutrients for plant and animal life. These mineral elements required by living organisms are obtained initially from inorganic sources such as phosphorus, sulphur, calcium and potassium. They usually occur as salts dissolved in soil water or lakes, streams and seas. Mineral salts come directly from the earth’s crust by weathering where the soluble salts enter the water cycle, eventually reaching the sea. Other salts are returned to the earth’s surface through sedimentation, and after weathering, they again enter the cycle. All living organisms fulﬁll their mineral requirements from mineral solutions in their environments. Other animals receive their mineral needs from the plants and animals they consume. After the death of living organisms, the minerals are returned to the soil and water through decomposition and ﬂow. Ecological Balance Ecological balance is a state of dynamic equilibrium within a community of organisms in a habitat or ecosystem. It can happen when the diversity of the living organisms remains relatively stable. Gradual changes do take place but that happens only through natural succession. It can also be explained as a stable balance in the numbers of each species in an ecosystem. This occurs through competition and cooperation between different organisms where population remains stable. This balance is brought about by the fact that certain species compete with one another determined by the environment in which they grow. This balance is also attained by the fact that some species depend on others for their food and sustenance. Such accounts are encountered in vast grasslands where the herbivorous animals (deer, zebras, buffaloes, etc.) are found in plenty. On the other hand, the carnivorous animals (tigers, lions, etc.) that are not usually in large numbers, hunt and feed on the herbivores, thereby controlling their population.

Since the water has to be moved up a stem against gravity, what provides the energy for this? 1 1 .3.2.1 Root Pressure As various ions from the soil are actively transported into the vascular tissues of the roots, water follows (its potential gradient) and increases the pressure inside the xylem. This positive pressure is called root pressure, and can be responsible for pushing up water to small heights in the stem. How can we see that root pressure exists? Choose a small soft-stemmed plant and on a day, when there is plenty of atmospheric moisture, cut the stem horizontally near the base with a sharp blade, early in the morning. You will soon see drops of solution ooze out of the cut stem; this comes out due to the positive root pressure. If you ﬁx a rubber tube to the cut stem as a sleeve you can actually collect and measure the rate of exudation, and also determine the composition of the exudates. Effects of root pressure is also observable at night and early morning when evaporation is low, and excess water collects in the form of droplets around special openings of veins near the tip of grass blades, and leaves of many herbaceous parts.

physics/,"I28 PIIYSICS We point out a common misconception created by newspapers and magazines. They mention food values in calories and urge us to restrict diet intake to below 2400 calories. What they should be saying is kilocalories (kcal) and not calories. A person consuming 2400 calories a day will soon starve to death! 1 food calorie is 1 kcal. 4 6.10.6 The Principle of Conservation of Energy We have seen that the total mechanical energy of the system is conserved if the forces doing work on it are conservative. If some of the forces involved are non-conservative, part of the mechanical energy may get transformed into other forms such as heat, light and sound. However, the total energy of an isolated system does not change, as long as one accounts for all forms of energy. Energy may be transformed from one form to another but the total energy of an isolated system remains constant. Energy can neither be created, nor destroyed. Since the universe as a whole may be viewed as an isolated system, the total energy of the universe is constant. If one part of the universe loses energy, another part must gain an equal amount of energy. The principle of conservation of energy cannot be proved. However, no violation of this principle has been observed. The concept of conservation and transformation of energy into various forms links together various branches of physics, chemistry and life sciences. It provides a unifying, enduring element in our scientific pursuits. From engineering point of view all electronic, communication and mechanical devices rely on some forms of energy transformation. 6. 1 1 POWER Often it is interesting to know not only the work done on an object, but also the rate at which this work is done. We say a person is physically fit if he not only climbs four ﬂoors of a building but climbs them fast. Power is defined as the time rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. The average power of a force is defined as the ratio of the work, W, to the total time ttaken 2019-20 W t The instantaneous power is defined as the limiting value of the average power as time interval approaches zero, p:d_W dt The work dW done by a force F for a displacement dr is dW = F.dr. The instantaneous power can also be expressed as P=F.£ dt = F.v (6.22) where v is the instantaneous velocity when the force is F. Power, like work and energy, is a scalar quantity. Its dimensions are [MLQT’3]. In the SI, its unit is called a watt (W). The watt is l J s4. The unit of power is named after James Watt, one of the innovators of the steam engine in the eighteenth century. There is another unit of power, namely the horse-power (hp) 1 hp = 746 W This unit is still used to describe the output of automobiles, motorbikes, etc. We encounter the unit watt when we buy electrical goods such as bulbs, heaters and refrigerators. A 100 watt bulb which is on for l 0 hours uses 1 kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy. 100 (watt) x 10 (hour) = 1000 watt hour = l kilowatt hour (kWh) = 103 (W) x 3600 (s) = 3.6 x 106 J Our electricity bills carry the energy consumption in units of kWh.

We found that the directional aspect of these quantities can be taken care of by + and — signs, as in one dimension only two directions are possible. But in order to describe motion of an object in two dimensions (a plane) or three dimensions (space), we need to use vectors to describe the above- mentioned physical quantities. Therefore, it is first necessary to learn the language of vectors. What is a vector? How to add, subtract and multiply vectors ? What is the result of multiplying a vector by a real number ? We shall learn this to enable us to use vectors for defining velocity and acceleration in a plane. We then discuss motion of an object in a plane. As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall discuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail the projectile motion. Circular motion is a familiar class of motion that has a special significance in daily-life situations. We shall discuss uniform circular motion in some detail. The equations developed in this chapter for motion in a plane can be easily extended to the case of three dimensions. 4.2 SCALARS AND VECTORS In physics, we can classify quantities as scalars or vectors. Basically, the difference is that a direction is associated with a vector but not with a scalar. A scalar quantity is a quantity with magnitude only. It is specified completely by a single number, along with the proper unit. Examples are : the distance between two points, mass of an object, the temperature of a body and the time at which a certain event happened. The rules for combining scalars are the rules of ordinary algebra. Scalars can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided 2019-20"

Viroids and Lichens C HAPTER 2 BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION Since the dawn of civilisation, there have been many attempts to classify living organisms. It was done instinctively not using criteria that were scientiﬁc but borne out of a need to use organisms for our own use — for food, shelter and clothing. Aristotle was the earliest to attempt a more scientiﬁc basis for classiﬁcation. He used simple morphological characters to classify plants into trees, shrubs and herbs. He also divided animals into two groups, those which had red blood and those that did not. In Linnaeus' time a Two Kingdom system of classification with Plantae and Animalia kingdoms was developed that included all plants and animals respectively. This system did not distinguish between the eukaryotes and prokaryotes, unicellular and multicellular organisms and photosynthetic (green algae) and non-photosynthetic (fungi) organisms. Classiﬁcation of organisms into plants and animals was easily done and was easy to understand, but, a large number of organisms did not fall into either category. Hence the two kingdom classification used for a long time was found inadequate. Besides, gross morphology a need was also felt for including other characteristics like cell structure, nature of wall, mode of nutrition, habitat, methods of reproduction, evolutionary relationships, etc. Classification systems for the living organisms have hence, undergone several changes over the time. Though plant and animal kingdoms have been a constant under all different systems, the understanding of what groups /organisms be included under these kingdoms have been changing; the number and nature of other kingdoms have also been understood differently by different scientists over the time. 2019-2020"

In unicellular organisms, all functions like digestion, respiration and reproduction are performed by a single cell. In the complex body of multicellular animals the same basic functions are carried out by different groups of cells in a well organised manner. The body of a simple organism like Hydra is made of different types of cells and the number of cells in each type can be in thousands. The human body is composed of billions of cells to perform various functions. How do these cells in the body work together? In multicellular animals, a group of similar cells alongwith intercellular substances perform a specific function. Such an organisation is called tissue. You may be surprised to know that all complex animals consist of only four basic types of tissues. These tissues are organised in specific proportion and pattern to form an organ like stomach, lung, heart and kidney. When two or more organs perform a common function by their physical and / or chemical interaction, they together form organ system, e.g., digestive system, respiratory system, etc. Cells, tissues, organs and organ systems split up the work in a way that exhibits division of labour and contribute to the survival of the body as a whole. 7. 1 ANIMAL TISSUES The structure of the cells vary according to their function. Therefore, the tissues are different and are broadly classified into four types : (i) Epithelial, (ii) Connective, (iii) Muscular and (iv) Neural. 2019-2020"
biology/,"PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS incident light beyond a point causes the breakdown of chlorophyll and a decrease in photosynthesis. 13.10.2 Carbon dioxide Concentration Carbon dioxide is the major limiting factor for photosynthesis. The concentration of CO2 is very low in the atmosphere (between 0.03 and 0.04 per cent). Increase in concentration upto 0.05 per cent can cause an increase in CO2 ﬁxation rates; beyond this the levels can become damaging over longer periods. The C3 and C 4 plants respond differently to CO2 concentrations. At low light conditions neither group responds to high CO2 conditions. At high light intensities, both C3 and C 4 plants show increase in the rates of photosynthesis. What is important to note is that the C 4 plants show saturation at about 360 ulL‘1 while C3 responds to increased CO2 concentration and saturation is seen only beyond 450 ulL'l. Thus, current availability of CO2 levels is limiting to the C3 plants. The fact that C3 plants respond to higher 002 concentration by showing increased rates of photosynthesis leading to higher productivity has been used for some greenhouse crops such as tomatoes and bell pepper. They are allowed to grow in carbon dioxide enriched atmosphere that leads to higher yields. 1 3. l 0. 3 Temperature The dark reactions being enzymatic are temperature controlled. Though the light reactions are also temperature sensitive they are affected to a much lesser extent. The C 4 plants respond to higher temperatures and show higher rate of photosynthesis while C3 plants have a much lower temperature optimum. The temperature optimum for photosynthesis of different plants also depends on the habitat that they are adapted to. Tropical plants have a higher temperature optimum than the plants adapted to temperate climates. 13. 10.4 Water Even though water is one of the reactants in the light reaction, the effect of water as a factor is more through its effect on the plant, rather than directly on photosynthesis. Water stress causes the stomata to close hence reducing the CO2 availability. Besides, water stress also makes leaves wilt, thus, reducing the surface area of the leaves and their metabolic activity as well."

This ability leads to the formation of different plant bodies - haploid and diploid. The haploid plant body produces gametes by mitosis. This plant body represents a gametophyte. Following fertilisation the zygote also divides by mitosis to produce a diploid sporophytic plant body. Haploid spores are produced by this plant body by meiosis. These in turn, divide by mitosis to form a haploid plant body once again. Thus, during the life cycle of any sexually reproducing plant, there is an alternation of generations between gamete producing haploid gametophyte and spore producing diploid sporophyte. However, different plant groups, as well as individuals representing them, differ in the following patterns: 1. Sporophytic generation is represented only by the one-celled zygote. There are no free-living sporophytes. Meiosis in the zygote results in the formation of haploid spores. The haploid spores divide mitotically and form the gametophyte. The dominant, photosynthetic phase in such plants is the free-living gametophyte. This kind of life cycle is termed as haplontic. Many algae such as Volvox, Spirogyra and some species of Chlamydomonas represent this pattern (Figure 3.7 a). 2. On the other extreme, is the type wherein the diploid sporophyte is the dominant, photosynthetic, independent phase of the plant. The gametophytic phase is represented by the single to few-celled haploid gametophyte. This kind of life cycle is termed as diplontic. An alga, Fucus sp., represents this pattern (Fig. 3.7 b). In addition, all seed bearing plants i.e., gymnosperms and angiosperms, follow this pattern with some variations, wherein, the gametophytic phase is few to multi-celled. 3. Bryophytes and pteridophytes, interestingly, exhibit an intermediate condition (Haplo-diplontic); both Figure 3.7 Life cycle patterns : (a) Haplontic phases are multicellular.

When we grind a tissue, we are disrupting the cell structure. Cell membrane and other membranes are broken into pieces, and form vesicles which are not water soluble. Therefore, these membrane fragments in the form of vesicles get separated along with the acid insoluble pool and hence in the macromolecular fraction. Lipids are not strictly macromolecules. The acid soluble pool represents roughly the cytoplasmic composition. The macromolecules from cytoplasm and organelles become the acid insoluble fraction. Together they represent the entire chemical composition of living tissues or organisms. In summary if we represent the chemical composition of living tissue from abundance point of view and arrange them class-wise, we observe that water is the most abundant chemical in living organisms (Table 9.4). 9.4 PROTEINS Proteins are polypeptides. They are linear chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds as shown in Figure 9.3. Each protein is a polymer of amino acids. As there are 20 types of amino acids (e.g., alanine, cysteine, proline, tryptophan, lysine, etc.), a protein is a heteropolymer and not a homopolymer. A homopolymer has only one type of monomer repeating ‘n’ number of times. This information about the amino acid content is important as later in your nutrition lessons, you will learn that certain amino acids are essential for our health and they have to be supplied through our diet. Hence, dietary proteins are the source of essential amino acids. Therefore, amino acids can be essential or non-essential. The latter are those which our body can make, while we get essential amino acids through our diet/ food.

Can you explain why twelve molecules of water as substrate are used in the equation given above? 13.3 WHERE DOES PHOTOSYNTHESIS TAKE PLACE? You would of course answer: in ‘the green leaf or ‘in the chloroplasts’, based on what you earlier read in Chapter 8. You are deﬁnitely right. Photosynthesis does take place in the green leaves of plants but it does so also in other green parts of the plants. Can you name some other parts where you think photosynthesis may occur? You would recollect from previous unit that the mesophyll cells in the leaves, have a large number of chloroplasts. Usually the chloroplasts align themselves along the walls of the mesophyll cells, such that they get the optimum quantity of the incident light. When do you think the chloroplasts will be aligned with their ﬂat surfaces parallel to the walls? When would they be perpendicular to the incident light? You have studied the structure of chloroplast in Chapter 8. Within the chloroplast there is membranous system consisting of grana, the stroma lamellae, and the matrix stroma (Figure 13.2). There is a clear division of labour within the chloroplast. The membrane system is responsible for trapping the light energy and also for the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. In stroma, enzymatic reactions synthesise sugar, which in turn forms starch. The former set of reactions, since they are directly light driven are called light reactions (photochemical reactions). The latter are not directly light driven but are dependent on the products of light reactions (ATP and NADPH). Hence, to distinguish the latter they are called, by convention, as dark reactions (carbon reactions). However, this should not be construed to mean that they occur in darkness or that they are not light-dependent.

In addition, for (b), the force on the block by the cylinder and the force on the cylinder by the block also constitute an action-reaction pair. The important thing to remember is that an action-reaction pair consists of mutual forces which are always equal and opposite between two bodies. Two forces on the same body which happen to be equal and opposite can never constitute an action-reaction pair. The force of gravity on the mass in (a) or (b) and the normal force on the mass by the ﬂoor are not action- reaction pairs. These forces happen to be equal and opposite for (a) since the mass is at rest. They are not so for case (b), as seen already. The weight of the system is 270 N, while the normal force R’ is 267.3 N. 4 The practice of drawing free-body diagrams is of great help in solving problems in mechanics. It allows you to clearly define your system and consider all forces on the system due to objects that are not part of the system itself. A number of exercises in this and subsequent chapters will help you cultivate this practice. SUMNIARY Aristotle's View that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong. A force is necessary in practice to counter the opposing force of friction. Galileo extrapolated simple observations on motion of bodies on inclined planes, and arrived at the law of inertia. Newton’s first law of motion is the same law rephrased thus: “Everybody continues to be in its state of rest or of unifom motion in a straight line, unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise’. In simple terms, the First Law is “If external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero"". Momentum (p) of a body is the product of its mass (m) and velocity (V) : p = mv Newton’s second law of motion : The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts. Thus F=kd—p=kma dt where F is the net external force on the body and a its acceleration. We set the constant of proportionality k = 1 in SI units. Then The SI unit of force is newton : 1 N = 1 kg m s2, [a] The second law is consistent with the First Law [F = 0 implies a = 0) (b) It is a vector equation (c) It is applicable to a particle, and also to a body or a system of particles, provided F is the total external force on the system and a is the acceleration of the system as a whole. (d) F at a point at a certain instant determines a at the same point at that instant. That is the Second Law is a local law; a at an instant does not depend on the history of motion. Impulse is the product of force and time which equals change in momentum. The notion of impulse is useful when a large force acts for a short time to produce a measurable change in momentum. Since the time of action of the force is very short, one can assume that there is no appreciable change in the position of the body during the action of the impulsive force. Newton’s third law of motion: To every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction 2019-20"

(see Figure 1 1.10). As glucose is prepared at the source (by photosynthesis) it is converted to sucrose (a dissacharide). The sugar is then moved in the form of sucrose into the companion cells and then into the living phloem sieve tube cells by active transport. This process of loading at the source produces a hypertonic condition in the phloem. Water in the adjacent xylem moves into the phloem by osmosis. As osmotic pressure builds up the phloem sap will move to areas of lower pressure. At the sink osmotic pressure must be reduced. Again active transport is necessary to move the sucrose out of the phloem sap and into the cells which will use the sugar — converting it into energy, starch, or cellulose. As sugars are removed, the osmotic pressure decreases and water moves out of the phloem. To summarise, the movement of sugars in the phloem begins at the source, where sugars are loaded (actively transported) into a sieve tube. Loading of the phloem sets up a water potential gradient that facilitates the mass movement in the phloem.

physics/,"G RAVITATI ON 187 This clearly shows that the force due to earth’s gravity decreases with distance. If one assumes that the gravitational force due to the earth decreases in proportion to the inverse square of the distance from the centre of the earth, we will have am ocRr‘n2 ; g on R132 and we get —=— z 3600 (8.4) in agreement with a value of g : 9.8 m s2 and the value of aIn from Eq. (8.3). These observations led Newton to propose the following Universal Law of Gravitation : Every body in the universe attracts every other body with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The quotation is essentially from Newton’s famous treatise called ‘Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy’ (Principia for short). Stated Mathematically, Newton’s gravitation law reads : The force F on a point mass m2 due to another point mass m1 has the magnitude m1 m2 |F|=G r—2 (8.5) Equation (8.5) can be expressed in vector form as F: G ml—Zm2(—f-)=—G nil—2""“;- T 1‘ m1 m2 ‘ — r M3 where G is the universal gravitational constant, } is the unit vector from m1 to m2 and r = r2 — 1'1 as shown in Fig. 8.3. 2 Fig. 8.3 Gravitational force on m1 due to m2 is along r where the vector 1' is (r2— 1-1). The gravitational force is attractive, i.e., the force F is along — r. The force on point mass m1 due to m2 is of course — F by Newton’s third law. Thus, the gravitational force F12 on the body 1 due to 2 and F21 on the body 2 due to l are related as F12 = — F21. Before we can apply Eq. (8.5) to objects under consideration, we have to be careful since the law refers to point masses whereas we deal with extended objects which have finite size.

Epidermal cells are parenchymatous with a small amount of cytoplasm lining the cell wall and a large vacuole. The outside of the epidermis is often covered with a waxy thick layer called the cuticle which prevents the loss of water. Cuticle is absent in roots. Stomata are structures present in the epidermis of leaves. Stomata regulate the process of transpiration and gaseous exchange. Each stoma is composed of two bean- shaped cells known as guard cells which enclose stomatal pore. In grasses, the guard cells are dumb-bell shaped. The outer walls of guard cells (away from the stomatal pore) are thin and the inner walls (towards the stomatal pore) are highly thickened. The guard cells possess chloroplasts and regulate the opening and closing of stomata. Sometimes, a few epidermal cells, in the vicinity of the guard cells become specialised in their shape and size and are known as subsidiary cells. The stomatal aperture, guard cells and the surrounding subsidiary cells are together called stomatal apparatus (Figure 6.4). Epidermal cells Subsidiary cells Chloroplast Guard cells Stomatal pore Figure 6.4 Diagrammatic representation: (a) stomata with bean-shaped guard cells (b) stomata with dumb-bell shaped guard cell The cells of epidermis bear a number of hairs. The root hairs are unicellular elongations of the epidermal cells and help absorb water and minerals from the soil. On the stem the epidermal hairs are called trichomes. The trichomes in the shoot system are usually multicellular. They may be branched or unbranched and soft or stiff. They may even be secretory. The trichomes help in preventing water loss due to transpiration. 6.2.2 The Ground Tissue System All tissues except epidermis and vascular bundles constitute the ground tissue. It consists of simple tissues such as parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma. Parenchymatous cells are usually present in cortex, pericycle, pith and medullary rays, in the primary stems and roots. In leaves, the ground tissue consists of thin-walled chloroplast containing cells and is called mesophyll. 2019-2020"
biology/,"82 BIOLOGY SUMMARY Flowering plants exhibit enormous variation in shape, size, structure, mode of nutrition, life span, habit and habitat. They have well developed root and shoot systems. Root system is either tap root or ﬁbrous. Generally, dicotyledonous plants have tap roots while monocotyledonous plants have ﬁbrous roots. The roots in some plants get modiﬁed for storage of food, mechanical support and respiration. The shoot system is differentiated into stem, leaves, ﬂowers and fruits. The morphological features of stems like the presence of nodes and internodes, multicellular hair and positively phototropic nature help to differentiate the stems from roots. Stems also get modiﬁed to perform diverse functions such as storage of food, vegetative propagation and protection under different conditions. Leaf is a lateral outgrowth of stem developed exogeneously at the node. These are green in colour to perform the function of photosynthesis. Leaves exhibit marked variations in their shape, size, margin, apex and extegtyof incisions of leafg‘lade (lamina).

Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Coronary Artery Disease, often referred to as atherosclerosis, affects the vessels that supply blood to the heart muscle. It is caused by deposits of calcium, fat, cholesterol and fibrous tissues, which makes the lumen of arteries narrower. Angina: It is also called ‘angina pectoris’. A symptom of acute chest pain appears when no enough oxygen is reaching the heart muscle. Angina can occur in men and women of any age but it is more common among the middle-aged and elderly. It occurs due to conditions that affect the blood ﬂow. Heart Failure: Heart failure means the state of heart when it is not pumping blood effectively enough to meet the needs of the body. It is sometimes called congestive heart failure because congestion of the lungs is one of the main symptoms of this disease. Heart failure is not the same as cardiac arrest (when the heart stops beating) or a heart attack (when the heart muscle is suddenly damaged by an inadequate blood supply). SUMMARY Vertebrates circulate blood, a ﬂuid connective tissue, in their body, to transport essential substances to the cells and to carry waste substances from there. Another ﬂuid, lymph (tissue ﬂuid) is also used for the transport of certain substances. Blood comprises of a ﬂuid matrix, plasma and formed elements. Red blood cells (RBCs, erythrocytes), white blood cells (WBCs, leucocytes) and platelets (thrombocytes) constitute the formed elements. Blood of humans are grouped into A, B, AB and 0 systems based on the presence or absence of two surface antigens, A, B on the RBCs. Another blood grouping is also done based on the presence or absence of another antigen called Rhesus factor (Rh) on the surface of RBCs. The spaces between cells in the tissues contain a ﬂuid derived from blood called tissue ﬂuid. This ﬂuid called lymph is almost similar to blood except for the protein content and the formed elements. All vertebrates and a few invertebrates have a closed circulatory system. Our circulatory system consists of a muscular pumping organ, heart, a network of vessels and a ﬂuid, blood. Heart has two atria and two ventricles. Cardiac musculature is auto-excitable. Sino-atrial node (SAN) generates the maximum number of action protentials per minute (70-75 / min) and therefore, it sets the pace of the activities of the heart. Hence it is called the Pacemaker. The action potential causes the atria and then the ventricles to undergo contraction (systole) followed by their relaxation (diastole). ’Ihe systole forces the blood to move ﬁ'om the atria to the ventricles and to the pulmonary artery and the aorta. The cardiac cycle is formed by sequential events in the heart which is cyclically repeated and is called the cardiac cycle. A healthy person shows 72 such cycles per minute. About 7 0 mL of blood is pumped out by each ventricle during a cardiac cycle and it is called the stroke or beat volume. Volume of blood pumped out by each ventricle of heart per minute is called the cardiac output and it is equal to the product of stroke volume and heart rate (approx 5 litres). The electrical activity of the heart can be recorded ﬁ‘om"

biology/,"168 BIOLOGY 10.4. 1 Meiosis I Prophase I: Prophase of the ﬁrst meiotic division is typically longer and more complex when compared to prophase of mitosis. It has been further subdivided into the following five phases based on chromosomal behaviour, i.e., Leptotene, Zygotene, Pachytene, Diplotene and Diakinesis. During leptotene stage the chromosomes become gradually visible under the light microscope. The compaction of chromosomes continues throughout leptotene. This is followed by the second stage of prophase I called zygotene. During this stage chromosomes start pairing together and this process of association is called synapsis. Such paired chromosomes are called homologous chromosomes. Electron micrographs of this stage indicate that chromosome synapsis is accompanied by the formation of complex structure called synaptonemal complex. The complex formed by a pair of synapsed homologous chromosomes is called a bivalent or a tetrad. However, these are more clearly visible at the next stage. The first two stages of prophase I are relatively short-lived compared to the next stage that is pachytene. During this stage, the four chromatids of each bivalent chromosomes becomes distinct and clearly appears as tetrads. This stage is characterised by the appearance of recombination nodules, the sites at which crossing over occurs between non-sister chromatids of the homologous chromosomes. Crossing over is the exchange of genetic material between two homologous chromosomes. Crossing over is also an enzyme-mediated process and the enzyme involved is called recombinase. Crossing over leads to recombination of genetic material on the two chromosomes. Recombination between homologous chromosomes is completed by the end of pachytene, leaving the chromosomes linked at the sites of crossing over. The beginning of diplotene is recognised by the dissolution of the synaptonemal complex and the tendency of the recombined homologous chromosomes of the bivalents to separate from each other except at the sites of crossovers. These X—shaped structures, are called chiasmata. In oocytes of some vertebrates, diplotene can last for months or years. The ﬁnal stage of meiotic prophase I is diakinesis. This is marked by terminalisation of chiasmata. During this phase the chromosomes are fully condensed and the meiotic spindle is assembled to prepare the homologous chromosomes for separation. By the end of diakinesis, the nucleolus disappears and the nuclear envelope also breaks down. Diakinesis represents transition to metaphase. Metaphase I: The bivalent chromosomes align on the equatorial plate (Figure 10.3). The microtubules from the opposite poles of the spindle attach to the kinetochore of homologous chromosomes."

We have yet to answer one major question in this connection. What is the analogue of mass in rotational motion? We shall attempt to answer this question in the present section. To keep the discussion simple, we shall consider rotation about a fixed axis only. Let us try to get an expression for the kinetic energy of a rotating body. We know that for a body rotating about a fixed axis, each particle of the body moves in a circle with linear velocity given by Eq. (7.19). (Refer to Fig. 7.16). For a particle at a distance from the axis, the linear velocity is vi = ria). The kinetic energy of motion of this particle is ki = lrnivi2 = imirizwz 2 2 where miis the mass of the particle. The total kinetic energy K of the body is then given by the sum of the kinetic energies of individual particles, K = ilk, = gimirfwz) i:1 i:1 Here n is the number of particles in the body. Note wis the same for all particles. Hence, taking wout of the sum, K = l(02(anmiri2) 2 i:l We define a new parameter characterising the rigid body, called the moment of inertia I , given by I = Emir? (7.34) i:l With this definition, 1 K = 51602 (7.35) Note that the parameter I is independent of the magnitude of the angular velocity. It is a characteristic of the rigid body and the axis about which it rotates. Compare Eq. (7 .35) for the kinetic energy of a rotating body with the expression for the kinetic energy of a body in linear (translational) motion, K=lmv2 2 Here, m is the mass of the body and v is its velocity. We have already noted the analogy between angular velocity to (in respect of rotational motion about a fixed axis) and linear velocity v (in respect of linear motion). It is then evident that the parameter, moment of inertia I, is the desired rotational analogue of mass in linear motion. In rotation (about a ﬁxed axis), the moment of inertia plays a similar role as mass does in linear motion. We now apply the definition Eq. (7.34), to calculate the moment of inertia in two simple cases. (a) Consider a thin ring of radius R and mass M, rotating in its own plane around its centre 2019-20"

It is convenient to resolve a general vector along the axes of a rectangular coordinate system using vectors of unit magnitude. These are called unit vectors that we discuss now. A unit vector is a vector of unit magnitude and points in a particular direction. It has no dimension and unit. It is used to specify a direction only. Unit vectors along the x—, y- and z—axes of a rectangular coordinate system are denoted by i 3 and 1}, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4.9(a). Since these are unit vectors, we have = ll‘: |=1 (4.9) ﬂ.) These unit vectors are perpendicular to each other. In this text, they are printed in bold face with a cap (A) to distinguish them from other vectors. Since we are dealing with motion in two dimensions in this chapter, we require use of only two unit vectors. If we multiply a unit vector, say 13 by a scalar, the result is a vector A. = kﬁ. In general, a vector A can be written as A = IAI ﬁ (4.10) where fl is a unit vector along A. We can now resolve a vector A in terms of component vectors that lie along unit vectors i and 3. Consider a vector A that lies in x—y plane as shown in Fig. 4.9(b). We draw lines from the head of A perpendicular to the coordinate axes as in Fig. 4.9(b), and get vectors Al and A2 A such that Al + A2 = A. Since Al is parallel to i y PHYSICS and A2 is parallel to 3, we have : A1=Ax§, 112:ij (4.11) where AX and Ag are real numbers. Thus, A = AX 3+ ij (4.12) This is represented in Fig. 4.9(c). The quantities AX and Ag are called x—, and y- components of the vector A. Note that AX is itself not a vector, but AX i is a vector, and so is Ag 3. Using simple trigonometry, we can express AX and Ag in terms of the magnitude of A and the angle 0y it makes with the x— axis. AX =Acos 0 Ag = A sin 6 (4.13) As is clear from Eq. (4.13), a component of a vector can be positive, negative or zero depending on the value of 0. Now, we have two ways to specify a vector A in a plane. It can be specified by : (i) its magnitude A and the direction 9 it makes with the x—axis; or (ii) its components AX and Ag If A and 9 are given, Axand Ay can be obtained using Eq. (4.13).

physics/,"MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 265 10.6. 1 Surface Energy A liquid stays together because of attraction between molecules. Consider a molecule well inside a liquid. The intermolecular distances are such that it is attracted to all the surrounding molecules [Fig. 10.16(a)]. This attraction results in a negative potential energy for the molecule, which depends on the number and distribution of molecules around the chosen one. But the average potential energy of all the molecules is the same. This is supported by the fact that to take a collection of such molecules (the liquid) (at) 0?) terms of this fact. What is the energy required for having a molecule at the surface? As mentioned above, roughly it is half the energy required to remove it entirely from the liquid i.e., half the heat of evaporation. Finally, what is a surface? Since a liquid consists of molecules moving about, there cannot be a perfectly sharp surface. The density of the liquid molecules drops rapidly to zero around 2 = O as we move along the direction indicated Fig 10.16 (c) in a distance of the order of a few molecular sizes.

(c) Balance of attractive (AI and repulsive (R) forces. and to disperse them far away from each other in order to evaporate or vaporise, the heat of evaporation required is quite large. For water it is of the order of 40 kJ/mol. Let us consider a molecule near the surface Fig. 10.16(b). Only lower half side of it is surrounded by liquid molecules. There is some negative potential energy due to these, but obviously it is less than that of a molecule in bulk, i.e., the one fully inside. Approximately it is half of the latter. Thus, molecules on a liquid surface have some extra energy in comparison to molecules in the interior. A liquid, thus, tends to have the least surface area which external conditions permit. Increasing surface area requires energy. Most surface phenomenon can be understood in 10.6.2 Surface Energy and Surface Tension As we have discussed that an extra energy is associated with surface of liquids, the creation of more surface (spreading of surface) keeping other things like volume fixed requires additional energy.

According to this principle, each pulse moves as if others are not present. The constituents of the medium, therefore, suffer displacments due to both and since the displacements can be positive and negative, the net displacement is an algebraic sum of the two. Fig. 15.9 gives graphs of the wave shape at different times. Note the dramatic effect in the graph (c); the displacements due to the two pulses have exactly cancelled each other and there is zero displacement throughout. To put the principle of superposition mathematically, let y1 (x, t) and y2 (x, t) be the displacements due to two wave disturbances in the medium. If the waves arrive in a region simultaneously, and therefore, overlap, the net displacement y (x, t) is given by y (x, t) = y,(x, t) + y2(x, t) (15.25) If we have two or more waves moving in the medium the resultant waveform is the sum of wave functions of individual waves. That is, if the wave functions of the moving waves are y1=f,(X—vt), yz =‘j;(x—Ut), y =fn(x—vt) 377 then the wave function describing the disturbance in the medium is y =f1(X— vt)+f2(x— vt)+ ...+fn(x— vt) Tl. = 'Zlfi (x—vt) (15.26) 1: The principle of superposition is basic to the phenomenon of interference.

Their wave speed will be identical. Let us further assume that their amplitudes are equal and they are both travelling in the positive direction of x-aXis. The waves only differ in their initial phase. According to Eq.

The ecological conﬂict and cooperation among members of a population and among populations of a community or even the molecular traffic inside a cell make us deeply reﬂect on — what indeed is life?

The molar specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by 0:139 ,u AT where u is the number of moles of the substance. For a solid, the law of equipartition of energy gives C = 3 R which generally agrees with experiment at ordinary temperatures. Calorie is the old unit of heat. 1 calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water from 14.5 °C to 15.5 °C. 1 cal = 4.186 J. For an ideal gas, the molar specific heat capacities at constant pressure and volume satisfy the relation Cp — CL, = R where R is the universal gas constant. Equilibrium states of a thermodynamic system are described by state variables. The value of a state variable depends only on the particular state, not on the path used to arrive at that state. Examples of state variables are pressure (P), volume (V), temperature (T), and mass (m). Heat and work are not state variables. An Equation of State (like the ideal gas equation PV = ,u RT) is a relation connecting different state variables. A quasi—static process is an infinitely slow process such that the system remains in thermal and mechanical equilibrium with the surroundings throughout. In a quasi—static process, the pressure and temperature of the environment can differ from those of the system only infinitesimally.

You also lmow that in dicotyledonous plants and gymnosperms, the lateral meristems, vascular cambium and cork-cambium appear later in life. These are the meristems that cause the increase in the girth of the organs in which they are active. This is known as secondary growth of the plant (see Figure 15.2). 15. 1.2 Growth is Measurable Growth, at a cellular level, is principally a consequence of increase in the amount of protoplasm. Since increase in protoplasm is difficult to measure directly, one generally measures some quantity which is more or less proportional to it. Growth is, therefore, measured by a variety of parameters some of which are: increase in fresh weight, dry weight, length, area, volume and cell number. You may ﬁnd it amazing to know that one single maize root apical mersitem can give rise to more than 17,500 new cells per hour, whereas cells in a watermelon may increase in size by upto 3,50,000 times. In the former, growth is expressed as increase in cell number; the latter expresses growth as increase in size of the cell. While the growth of a pollen tube is measured in terms of its length, an increase in surface area denotes the grth in a dorsiventral leaf. 15. 1.3 Phases of Growth The period of growth is generally divided into three phases, namely, meristematic, elongation and maturation (Figure 1 5.3). Let us understand this by looking at the root tips. The constantly dividing cells, both at the root apex and the shoot apex, represent the meristematic phase of growth.

Cell junctions fuse the plasma membranes of cardiac muscle cells and make them stick together (Figure 7.70).

Cilia are small structures which work like oars, causing the movement of either the cell or the surrounding ﬂuid. Flagella are comparatively longer and responsible for cell movement. The prokaryotic bacteria also possess ﬂagella but these are structurally different from that of the eukaryotic ﬂagella. The electron microscopic study of a cilium or the ﬂagellum show that they are covered with plasma membrane. Their core called the axoneme, possesses a number of microtubules running parallel to the long axis. The axoneme usually has nine doublets of radially arranged peripheral microtubules, and a pair of centrally located microtubules. Such an arrangement of axonemal microtubules is referred to as the 9+2 array (Figure 8.10). The central tubules are connected by bridges and is also enclosed by a central sheath, which is connected to one of the tubules of each peripheral doublets by a radial spoke. Thus, there are nine radial spokes. The peripheral doublets are also interconnected by linkers. Both the cilium and ﬂagellum emerge from centriole-like structure called the basal bodies. 8.5.9 Centrosome and Centrioles Centrosome is an organelle usually containing two cylindrical structures called centrioles.

For example, a metre scale is used for lengths from 10’3m to 102 m. A vernier callipers is used for lengths to an accuracy of 10‘4 m. A screw gauge and a spherometer can be used to measure lengths as less as to l O’5m. To measure lengths beyond these ranges, we make use of some special indirect methods. 2019-20 5‘ F3 930‘an 5‘ SD h d X L t C 60 min = 3600 s 24 h = 86400 s 365.25 d = 3.156 x 107 5 1° = (11/ 180) rad I dma = 10“3 m3 103 kg 200 mg 0.1 MPa = 105Pa 3.7 x 10‘0 s“ 2.58 x 10“ C/kg 100 kg 100 fm2= 10‘28 m2 1 dam“ = 10‘ m2 1 hm2 = 104 m2 101325 Pa = 1.013 x 105 Pa 2.3.1 Measurement of Large Distances Large distances such as the distance of a planet or a star from the earth cannot be measured directly with a metre scale. An important method in such cases is the parallax method. When you hold a pencil in front of you against some specific point on the background (a wall) and look at the pencil first through your left eye A (closing the right eye) and then look at the pencil through your right eye B (closing the left eye), you would notice that the position of the pencil seems to change with respect to the point on the wall. This is called parallax. The distance between the two points of observation is called the basis. In this example, the basis is the distance between the eyes. To measure the distance D of a far away planet S by the parallax method, we observe it from two different positions (observatories) A and B on the Earth, separated by distance AB = b at the same time as shown in Fig. 2.2. We measure the angle between the two directions along which the planet is viewed at these two points. The AASB in Fig. 2.2 represented by symbol 0 is called the parallax angle or parallactic angle. As the planet is very far away, 5 << 1, and therefore, 0 is very small. Then we approximately take AB as an arc of length b of a circle with centre at S and the distance D as"

We have already compared kinematics of the two motions. Also, we know that in rotational motion moment of inertia and torque play the same role as mass and force respectively in linear motion. Given this we should be able to guess what the other analogues indicated in the table are. For example, we know that in linear motion, work done is given by F dx, in rotational motion about a fixed axis it should be rdﬂ, since we already know the correspondence dx _> d0 and F _> 1- . It is, however, necessary that these correspondences are established on sound dynamical considerations. This is what we now turn to. Before we begin, we note a simpliﬁcation that arises in the case of rotational motion about a ﬁxed axis. Since the axis is fixed, only those components of torques, which are along the direction of the fixed axis need to be considered in our discussion. Only these components can cause the body to rotate about the axis. A component of the torque perpendicular to the axis of rotation will tend to turn the axis from its position. We specifically assume that there will arise necessary forces of constraint to cancel the effect of the perpendicular components of the (external) torques, so that the fixed position of the axis will be maintained. The perpendicular components of the torques, therefore need not be taken into account. This means that for our calculation of torques on a rigid body: (1) We need to consider only those forces that lie in planes perpendicular to the axis. Forces which are parallel to the axis will give torques perpendicular to the axis and need not be taken into account. (2) We need to consider only those components of the position vectors which are perpendicular to the axis. Components of position vectors along the axis will result in torques perpendicular to the axis and need not be taken into account. Work done by a torque y' Fig. 7.34 Work done by a force F1 acting on a particle of a body rotating about a ﬁxed axis; the particle describes a circular path with centre C on the axis; arc P1P’1(ds1) gives the displacement of the particle. Figure 7 .34 shows a cross-section of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis, which is taken as the z-axis (perpendicular to the plane of the page; see Fig. 7.33). As said above we need to consider only those forces which lie in planes perpendicular to the axis. Let F1 be one such typical force acting as shown on a particle of the body at point P1 with its line of action in a plane perpendicular to the axis. For convenience we call this to be the x’—y’ plane (coincident with the plane of the page). The particle at P1 describes a circular path of radius r1 with centre C on the axis; CP1 = r1. In time At, the point moves to the position Pl’. The displacement of the particle dsl, therefore, has magnitude ds1 = rlde and direction tangential at P1 to the circular path as shown.

biology/,"EXCRETORY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ELIMINATION in the medullary interstitium. Presence of such interstitial gradient helps in an easy passage of water from the collecting tubule thereby concentrating the ﬁltrate (urine). Human kidneys can produce urine nearly four times concentrated than the initial ﬁltrate formed. 19.5 REGULATION OF KIDNEY FUNCTION The functioning of the kidneys is efﬁciently monitored and regulated by hormonal feedback mechanisms involving the hypothalamus, J GA and to a certain extent, the heart. Osmoreceptors in the body are activated by changes in blood volume, body ﬂuid volume and ionic concentration. An excessive loss of ﬂuid from the body can activate these receptors which stimulate the hypothalamus to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin from the neurohypophysis. ADH facilitates water reabsorption from latter parts of the tubule, thereby preventing diuresis. An increase in body ﬂuid volume can switch off the osmoreceptors and suppress the ADH release to complete the feedback. ADH can also affect the kidney function by its constrictory effects on blood vessels. This causes an increase in blood pressure. An increase in blood pressure can increase the glomerular blood ﬂow and thereby the GFR. The J GA plays a complex regulatory role. A fall in glomerular blood ﬂow/glomerular blood pressure / GFR can activate the JG cells to release renin which converts angiotensinogen in blood to angiotensin I and further to angiotensin II. Angiotensin 11, being a powerful vasoconstrictor, increases the glomerular blood pressure and thereby GFR. Angiotensin II also activates the adrenal cortex to release Aldosterone. Aldosterone causes reabsorption of Na’“ and water from the distal parts of the tubule. This also leads to an increase in blood pressure and GFR. This complex mechanism is generally known as the Renin-Angiotensin mechanism. An increase in blood ﬂow to the atria of the heart can cause the release of Atrial Natriuretic Factor (AN F). AN F can cause vasodilation (dilation of blood vessels) and thereby decrease the blood pressure. AN F mechanism, therefore, acts as a check on the renin-angiotensin mechanism. 19.6 MICTURITION Urine formed by the nephrons is ultimately carried to the urinary bladder where it is stored till a voluntary signal is given by the central nervous system (CNS). This signal is initiated by the stretching of the urinary bladder as it gets ﬁlled with urine. In response, the stretch receptors on the walls of the bladder send signals to the CNS. ’Ihe CNS passes on motor messages"

Thus the equation for the motion of the trolley is T— 0.04X 200 = 20 a Or T— 8 = 20a. These equations give a = 2 m s*2 = 0.96 m s2 23 andT =27.1 N. 4 Rolling friction A body like a ring or a sphere rolling without slipping over a horizontal plane will suffer no friction, in principle. At every instant, there is just one point of contact between the body and the plane and this point has no motion relative to the plane. In this ideal situation, kinetic or static friction is zero and the body should continue to roll with constant velocity. We know, in practice, this will not happen and some resistance to motion (rolling friction) does occur, i.e. to keep the body rolling, some applied force is needed. For the same weight, rolling friction is much smaller (even by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude) than static or sliding friction. This is the reason why discovery of the wheel has been a major milestone in human history. Rolling friction again has a complex origin, though somewhat different from that of static and sliding friction. During rolling, the surfaces in contact get momentarily deformed a little, and this results in a finite area (not a point) of the body being in contact with the surface. The net effect is that the component of the contact force parallel to the surface opposes motion. We often regard friction as something undesirable. In many situations, like in a machine with different moving parts, friction does have a negative role. It opposes relative motion and thereby dissipates power in the form of heat, etc. Lubricants are a way of reducing kinetic friction in a machine. Another way is to use ball bearings between two moving parts of a machine [Fig. 5.13(a)]. Since the rolling friction between ball bearings and the surfaces in contact is very small, power dissipation is reduced. A thin cushion of air maintained between solid surfaces in relative motion is another effective way of reducing friction (Fig. 5.13(a)). In many practical situations, however, friction is critically needed. Kinetic friction that dissipates power is nevertheless important for quickly stopping relative motion. It is made use of by brakes in machines and automobiles. Similarly, static friction is important in daily life. We are able to walk because of friction. It is impossible for a car to move on a very slippery road. On an ordinary road, the friction between the tyres and the road provides the necessary external force to accelerate the car.

The cerebellum integrates information received from the semicircular canals of the ear and the auditory system. The medulla contains centres, which control respiration, cardiovascular reﬂexes, and gastric secretions. Pons consist of ﬁbre tracts that interconnect different regions of the brain.

It contains several groups of neurosecretory cells called nuclei which produce hormones. These hormones regulate the synthesis and secretion of pituitary hormones. However, the hormones produced by hypothalamus are of two types, the releasing hormones (which stimulate secretion of pituitary hormones) and the inhibiting hormones (which inhibit secretions of pituitary hormones). For example a hypothalamic hormone called Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates the pituitary synthesis and release of gonadotrophins. On the other hand, somatostatin from the hypothalamus inhibits the release of grth hormone from the pituitary. These hormones originating in the hypothalamic neurons, pass through axons and are released from their nerve endings. These hormones reach the pituitary gland through a portal circulatory system and regulate the functions of the anterior pituitary.

biology/,"BIOLOGY 1.2 DIVERSITY IN THE LIVING WORLD If you look around you will see a large variety of living organisms, be it potted plants, insects, birds, your pets or other animals and plants. There are also several organisms that you cannot see with your naked eye but they are all around you. If you were to increase the area that you make observations in, the range and variety of organisms that you see would increase. Obviously, if you were to visit a dense forest, you would probably see a much greater number and kinds of living organisms in it. Each different kind of plant, animal or organism that you see, represents a species. The number of species that are known and described range between 1 .7- 1.8 million. This refers to biodiversity or the number and types of organisms present on earth. We should remember here that as we explore new areas, and even old ones, new organisms are continuously being identiﬁed. As stated earlier, there are millions of plants and animals in the world; we know the plants and animals in our own area by their local names. These local names would vary from place to place, even within a country. Probably you would recognise the confusion that would be created if we did not ﬁnd ways and means to talk to each other, to refer to organisms we are talking about. Hence, there is a need to standardise the naming of living organisms such that a particular organism is known by the same name all over the world. This process is called nomenclature. Obviously, nomenclature or naming is only possible when the organism is described correctly and we know to what organism the name is attached to. This is identiﬁcation. In order to facilitate the study, number of scientists have established procedures to assign a scientiﬁc name to each known organism. This is acceptable to biologists all over the world. For plants, scientiﬁc names are based on agreed principles and criteria, which are provided in International Code for Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN). You may ask, how are animals named? Animal taxonomists have evolved International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). The scientiﬁc names ensure that each organism has only one name. Description of any organism should enable the people (in any part of the world) to arrive at the same name. They also ensure that such a name has not been used for any other known organism. Biologists follow universally accepted principles to provide scientiﬁc names to known organisms. Each name has two components — the Generic name and the speciﬁc epithet. This system of providing a name with two components is called Binomial nomenclature. This naming system given by Carolus Linnaeus is being practised by biologists all over the world. This naming system using a two word format was found convenient. Let us take the example of mango to understand the way of"
physics/,"92 PHYSICS Galileo Galilei (1564 - 1642) Galileo Galilei. born in Pisa, Italy in 1564 was a key figure in the scientiﬁc revolution in Europe about four centuries ago. Galileo proposed the concept of acceleration. From experiments on motion of bodies on inclined planes or falling freely. he contradicted the Aristotelian notion that a force was required to keep a body in motion. and that heavier bodies fall faster than lighter bodies under gravity. He thus arrived at the law of inertia that was the starting point of the subsequent epochal work of Isaac Newton. Galileo's discoveries in astronomy were equally revolutionary. In 1609. he designed his own telescope (invented earlier in Holland) and used it to make a number of startling observations : mountains and depressions on the surface of the moon: dark spots on the sun: the moons of J upiter and the phases of Venus. He concluded that the Milky Way derived its luminosity because of a large number of stars not visible to the naked eye. In his masterpiece of scientiﬁc reasoning : Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems, Galileo advocated the heliocentric theory of the solar system proposed by Copernicus. which eventually got universal acceptance. With Galileo came a turning point in the very method of scientiﬁc inquiry. Science was no longer merely observations of nature and inferences from them. Science meant devising and doing experiments to verify or refute theories. Science meant measurement of quantities and a search for mathematical relations between them. Not undeservedly. many regard Galileo as the father of modern science. More often, however, we do not know all the forces to begin with. In that case, if we know that an object is unaccelerated (i.e. it is either at rest or in uniform linear motion), we can infer from the ﬁrst law that the net external force on the object must be zero. Gravity is everywhere. For terrestrial phenomena, in particular, every object experiences gravitational force due to the earth. Also objects in motion generally experience friction, viscous drag, etc. If then, on earth, an object is at rest or in uniform linear motion, it is not because there are no forces acting on it, but because the various external forces cancel out i.e. add up to zero net external force. Consider a book at rest on a horizontal surface Fig. (5.2(a)). It is subject to two external forces : the force due to gravity (i.e. its weight W) acting downward and the upward force on the book by the table, the normal force R . Ris a self-adjusting force. This is an example of the kind of situation mentioned above. The forces are not quite known fully but the state of motion is known. We observe the book to be at rest. Therefore, we conclude from the first law that the magnitude of R equals that of W. A statement often encountered is : “Since W= R, forces cancel and, therefore, the book is at rest”. This is incorrect reasoning. The correct statement is : “Since the book is observed to be at rest, the net external force on it must be zero, according to the ﬁrst law. This implies that the 2019-20 normal force R must be equal and opposite to the weight W (a) (b) Fig. 5.2 (a) a book at rest on the table, and (b) a car moving with uniform velocity. The net force is zero in each case. Consider the motion of a car starting from rest, picking up speed and then moving on a smooth straight road with uniform speed (Fig. (5.2(b)). When the car is stationary, there is no net force acting on it. During pick-up, it accelerates. This must happen due to a net external force. Note, it has to be an external force. The acceleration of the car cannot be accounted for by any internal force. This might sound surprising, but it is true. The only conceivable external force along the road is the force of friction. It is the frictional force that accelerates the car as a whole. (You will learn about friction in section 5.9). When the car moves with constant velocity, there is no net external force."

In the original Celsius scale, these latter ﬁxed points were exactly at 0 °C and 100 °C (by choice), but now the triple point of water is the preferred choice for the ﬁxed point, because it has a unique temperature. A liquid in equilibrium with vapour has the same pressure and temperature throughout the system; the two phases in equilibrium differ in their molar volume [i.e. density). This is true for a system with any number of phases in equilibrium. Heat transfer always involves temperature difference between two systems or two parts of the same system. Any energy transfer that does not involve temperature difference in some way is not heat. Convection involves ﬂow of matter within a ﬂuid due to unequal temperatures of its parts.

physics/,"276 PHYSICS APPENDIX 10. 1 : WHAT IS BLOOD PRESSURE ? In evolutionary history there occurred a time when animals started spending a significant amount of time in the upright position. This placed a number of demands on the circulatory system. The venous system that returns blood from the lower extremities to the heart underwent changes. You will recall that veins are blood vessels through which blood returns to the heart. Humans and animals such as the giraffe have adapted to the problem of moving blood upward against gravity. But animals such as snakes, rats and rabbits will die if held upwards, since the blood remains in the lower extremities and the venous system is unable to move it towards the heart. 26.8 kPa 9.3 kPa 13. kPa 13.3 kPa 13.1 kPa Fig. 1 0.26 Schematic view of the gauge pressures in the arteries in various parts of the human body while standing or lying down. The pressures shown are averaged over a heart cycle. Figure 10.26 shows the average pressures observed in the arteries at various points in the human body. Since viscous effects are small, we can use Bernoulli’s equation, Eq. (10.13), P + éva + pgy = Constant to understand these pressure values. The kinetic energy term [p v2/2] can be ignored since the velocities in the three arteries are small (: 0.1 m s4] and almost constant. Hence the gauge pressures at the brain PB, the heart PH, and the foot PF are related by PF=PH+ pth=PB+pghB [10.34] where p is the density of blood. Typical values of the heights to the heart and the brain are hH = 1.3 m and hB = 1.7m. Taking p = 1.06 x 103 kg m’3 we obtain that PF = 26.8 kPa (kilopascals) and PB = 9.3 kPa given that PH = 13.3 kPa. Thus the pressures in the lower and upper parts of the body are so different when a person is standing, but are almost equal when he is lying down. As mentioned in the text the units for pressure more commonly employed in medicine and physiology are torr and mm of Hg. 1 mm of Hg = 1 torr = 0.133 kPa. Thus the average pressure at the heart is PH = 13.3 kPa = 100 mm of Hg. The human body is a marvel of nature. The veins in the lower extremities are equipped with valves, which open when blood ﬂows towards the heart and close if it tends to drain down. Also, blood is returned at least partially by the pumping action associated with breathing and by the ﬂexing of the skeletal muscles during walking. This explains why a soldier who is required to stand at attention may faint because of insufficient return of the blood to the heart. Once he is made to lie down, the pressures become equalized and he regains consciousness. An instrument called the sphygmomanometer usually measures the blood pressure of humans. It is a fast, painless and non—invasive technique and gives the doctor a reliable idea about the patients health. The measurement process is shown in Fig. 10.27. There are two reasons why the upper arm is used. First, it is at the same level as the heart and measurements here give values close to that at the heart. Secondly, the upper arm contains a single bone and makes the artery there [called the brachial artery) easy to compress. We have all measured pulse rates by placing our fingers over the wrist. Each pulse takes a little less than a second. During each pulse the pressure in the heart and the circulatory system goes through a 2019-20"

It also increases the genetic variability in the population of organisms from one generation to the next. Variations are very important for the process of evolution. SUMMARY According to the cell theory, cells arise from preexisting cells. The process by which this occurs is called cell division. Any sexually reproducing organism starts its life cycle from a single-celled zygote. Cell division does not stop with the formation of the mature organism but continues throughout its life cycle."
biology/,"282 BIOLOGY 18.2 LYMPH (TISSUE FLUID) As the blood passes through the capillaries in tissues, some water along with many small water soluble substances move out into the spaces between the cells of tissues leaving the larger proteins and most of the formed elements in the blood vessels. This ﬂuid released out is called the interstitial ﬂuid or tissue ﬂuid. It has the same mineral distribution as that in plasma. Exchange of nutrients, gases, etc., between the blood and the cells always occur through this ﬂuid. An elaborate network of vessels called the lymphatic system collects this ﬂuid and drains it back to the major veins. The ﬂuid present in the lymphatic system is called the lymph. Lymph is a colourless ﬂuid containing specialised lymphocytes which are responsible for the immune responses of the body. Lymph is also an important carrier for nutrients, hormones, etc. Fats are absorbed through lymph in the lacteals present in the intestinal villi. 18.3 CIRCULATORY PATHWAYS The circulatory patterns are of two types — open or closed. Open circulatory system is present in arthropods and molluscs in which blood pumped by the heart passes through large vessels into open spaces or body cavities called sinuses. Annelids and chordates have a closed circulatory system in which the blood pumped by the heart is always circulated through a closed network of blood vessels. This pattern is considered to be more advantageous as the ﬂow of ﬂuid can be more precisely regulated. All vertebrates possess a muscular chambered heart. Fishes have a 2-chambered heart with an atrium and a ventricle. Amphibians and the reptiles (except crocodiles) have a 3-chambered heart with two atria and a single ventricle, whereas crocodiles, birds and mammals possess a 4—chambered heart with two atria and two ventricles. In ﬁshes the heart pumps out deoxygenated blood which is oxygenated by the gills and supplied to the body parts from where deoxygenated blood is returned to the heart (single circulation). In amphibians and reptiles, the left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the gills / lungs / skin and the right atrium gets the deoxygenated blood from other body parts. However, they get mixed up in the single ventricle which pumps out mixed blood (incomplete double circulation). In birds and mammals, oxygenated and deoxygenated blood received by the left and right atria respectively passes on to the ventricles of the same sides. The ventricles pump it out without any mixing up, i.e., two separate circulatory pathways are present in these organisms, hence, these animals have double circulation. Let us study the human circulatory system."

J} BIOLOGY There are three major ways in which different cells handle pyruvic acid produced by glycolysis. These are lactic acid fermentation, alcoholic fermentation and aerobic respiration. Fermentation takes place under anaerobic conditions in many prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes. For the complete oxidation of glucose to CO2 and H20, however, organisms adopt Krebs’ cycle which is also called as aerobic respiration. This requires 02 supply. 14.3 FERMENTATION In fermentation, say by yeast, the incomplete oxidation of glucose is achieved under anaerobic conditions by sets of reactions where pyruvic acid is converted to CO2 and ethanol. The enzymes, pyruvic acid decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase catalyse these reactions. Other organisms like some bacteria produce lactic acid from pyruvic acid. The steps involved are shown in Figure 14.2. In animal cells also, like muscles during exercise, when oxygen is inadequate for cellular respiration pyruvic acid is reduced to lactic acid by lactate dehydrogenase. The reducing agent is NADH+H+ which is reoxidised to NAD+ in both the processes. In both lactic acid and alcohol fermentation not much energy is released; less than seven per cent of the energy in glucose is released and not all of it is trapped as high energy bonds of ATP. Also, the processes are hazardous — either acid or alcohol is produced. What is the net ATPs that is synthesised (calculate how many ATP are synthesised and deduct the number of ATP utilised during glycolysis) when one molecule of glucose is fermented to alcohol or lactic acid? Yeasts poison themselves to death when the concentration of alcohol reaches about 13 per cent. What then would be the acid x NADH+H maximum concentration of alcohol in beverages that are naturally fermented? NAD How do you think alcoholic beverages of Ethanol+CO2 alcohol content greater than this concentration are obtained? What then is the process by which respiration organisms can carry out complete oxidation of glucose and extract the energy stored to"

biology/,"BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASES sternum causing an increase in the volume of the thoracic chamber in the dorso-ventral axis. The overall increase in the thoracic volume causes a similar increase in pulmonary volume. An increase in pulmonary volume decreases the intra—pulmonary pressure to less than the atmospheric pressure which forces the air from outside to move into the lungs, i.e., inspiration (Figure 17 .2a). Relaxation of the diaphragm and the inter-costal muscles returns the diaphragm and sternum to their normal positions and reduce the thoracic volume and thereby the pulmonary volume. This leads to an increase in intra—pulmonary pressure to slightly above the atmospheric pressure causing the expulsion of air from the lungs, i.e., expiration (Figure 1 7 .2b). We have the ability to increase the strength of inspiration and expiration with the help of additional muscles in the abdomen. On an average, a healthy human breathes 12-16 times/ minute. The volume of air involved in breathing movements can be estimated by using a spirometer which helps in clinical assessment of pulmonary functions. 17.2. 1 Respiratory Volumes and Capacities Tidal Volume (TV): Volume of air inspired or expired during a normal respiration. It is approx. 500 mL., i.e., a healthy man can inspire or expire approximately 6000 to 8000 mL of air per minute.

The individual chromosomes can no longer be seen and each set of chromatin material tends to collect at each of the two poles (Figure 10.2 d). This is the stage which shows the following key events: 0 Chromosomes cluster at opposite spindle poles and their identity is lost as discrete elements. 0 Nuclear envelope develops around the chromosome clusters at each pole forming two daughter nuclei. 0 Nucleolus, golgi complex and ER reform. 10.2.5 Cytokinesis Mitosis accomplishes not only the segregation of duplicated chromosomes into daughter nuclei (karyokinesis), but the cell itself is divided into two daughter cells by the separation of cytoplasm called cytokinesis at the end of which cell division gets completed (Figure 10.2 e). In an animal cell, this is achieved by the appearance of a furrow in the plasma membrane. The furrow gradually deepens and ultimately joins in the centre dividing the cell cytoplasm into two. Plant cells however, are enclosed by a relatively inextensible cell wall, thererfore they undergo cytokinesis by a different mechanism. In plant cells, wall formation starts in the centre of the cell and grows outward to meet the existing lateral walls. The formation of the new cell wall begins with the formation of a simple precursor, called the cell-plate that represents the middle lamella between the walls of two adjacent cells. At the time of cytoplasmic division, organelles like mitochondria and plastids get distributed between the two daughter cells. In some organisms karyokinesis is not followed by cytokinesis as a result of which multinucleate condition arises leading to the formation of syncytium (e. g., liquid endosperm in coconut)."
physics/,"Seeing is Believing Can one see atoms rushing about. Almost but not quite. One can see pollen grains of a ﬂower being pushed around by molecules of water. The size of the grain is ~ 10’5 m. In 1827, a Scottish botanist Robert Brown. while examining. under a microscope. pollen grains of a ﬂower suspended in water noticed that they continuously moved about in a zigzag. random fashion. Kinetic theory provides a simple explanation of the phenomenon. Any object suspended in water is continuously bombarded from all sides by the water molecules. Since the motion of molecules is random, the number of molecules hitting the object in any direction is about the same as the number hitting in the opposite direction. The small difference between these molecular hits is negligible compared to the total number of hits for an object of ordinary size. and we do not notice any movement of the object. When the object is sufficiently small but still visible under a microscope, the difference in molecular hits from different directions is not altogether negligible. i.e. the impulses and the torques given to the suspended object through continuous bombardment by the molecules of the medium [water or some other ﬂuid) do not exactly sum to zero. There is a net impulse and torque in this or that direction. The suspended object thus, moves about in a zigzag manner and tumbles about randomly. This motion called now ‘Brownian motion” is a visible proof of molecular activity. In the last 50 years or so molecules have been seen by scanning tunneling and other special microscopes. [n 1987 Ahmed Zewail. an Egyptian scientist working in USA was able to observe not only the molecules but also their detailed interactions. He did this by illuminating them with ﬂashes of laser light for very short durations, of the order of tens of femtoseconds and photographing them. ( l femto- second = 10'15 s ).

We now use an atomic standard of time, which is based on the periodic vibrations produced in a cesium atom. This is the basis of the cesium clock, sometimes called atomic clock, used in the national standards. Such standards are available in many laboratories. In the cesium atomic clock, the second is taken as the time needed for 9,192.63 1,770 vibrations of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of cesium- 133 atom. The vibrations of the cesium atom regulate the rate of this cesium atomic clock just as the vibrations of a balance wheel regulate an ordinary wristwatch or the vibrations of a small quartz crystal regulate a quartz wristwatch. The cesium atomic clocks are very accurate. In principle they provide portable standard. The national standard of time interval ‘second’ as well as the frequency is maintained through four cesium atomic clocks. A cesium atomic clock is used at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi to maintain the Indian standard of time. In our country, the NFL has the responsibility of maintenance and improvement of physical standards, including that of time, frequency, etc. Note that the Indian Standard Time (IST) is linked to this set of atomic clocks. The efficient cesium atomic clocks are so accurate that they impart the uncertainty in time realisation as 2019-20 i l x 10—13, i.e. 1 part in 1013. This implies that the uncertainty gained over time by such a device is less than 1 part in 1013; they lose or gain no more than 3 us in one year. In View of the tremendous accuracy in time measurement, the SI unit of length has been expressed in terms the path length light travels in certain interval of time (1/299, 792, 458 of a second) (Table 2.1). The time interval of events that we come across in the universe vary over a very wide range. Table 2.5 gives the range and order of some typical time intervals. You may notice that there is an interesting coincidence between the numbers appearing in Tables 2.3 and 2.5. Note that the ratio of the longest and shortest lengths of objects in our universe is about 1041. Interestingly enough, the ratio of the longest and shortest time intervals associated with the events and objects in our universe is also about 1041. This number, 1041 comes up again in Table 2.4, which lists typical masses of objects. The ratio of the largest and smallest masses of the objects in our universe is about (10“)? Is this a curious coincidence between these large numbers purely accidental ? 2. 6 ACCURACY, PRECISION OF INSTRUMENTS AND ERRORS IN MEASUREMENT Measurement is the foundation of all experimental science and technology. The result of every measurement by any measuring instrument contains some uncertainty. This uncertainty is called error. Every calculated quantity which is based on measured values, also has an error. We shall distinguish between two terms: accuracy and precision. The accuracy of a measurement is a measure of how close the measured value is to the true value of the quantity. Precision tells us to what resolution or limit the quantity is measured. The accuracy in measurement may depend on several factors, including the limit or the resolution of the measuring instrument. For example, suppose the true value of a certain length is near 3.678 cm. In one experiment, using a measuring instrument of resolution 0. 1 cm, the measured value is found to be 3.5 cm, while in another experiment using a measuring device of greater resolution, say 0.0 1 cm, the length is determined to be 3.38 cm.

geography/,"132 Species Diversity This refers to the variety of species. It relates to the number of species in a deﬁned area. The diversity of species can be measured through its richness, abundance and types. Some areas are more rich in species than others. Areas rich in species diversity are called hotspots of diversity (Figure l 6.5). Ecosystem Diversity You have studied about the ecosystem in the earlier chapter. The broad differences between ecosystem types and the diversity of habitats and ecological processes occurring within each ecosystem type constitute the ecosystem diversity. The ‘boundaries’ of communities (associations of species) and ecosystems are not very rigidly defined. Thus, the demarcation of ecosystem boundaries is difficult and complex. Figure 16. 1 : Grasslands and sholas in Indira Gandhi National Park, Annamalai, Western Ghats — an example of ecosystem diversity Importance of Biodiversity Biodiversity has contributed in many ways to the development of human culture and, in turn, human communities have played a major role in shaping the diversity of nature at the genetic, species and ecological levels. Biodiversity plays the following roles: ecological, economic and scientific. Ecological Role of Biodiversity Species of many kinds perform some function or the other in an ecosystem. Nothing in an FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY ecosystem evolves and sustains without any reason. That means, every organism, besides extracting its needs, also contributes something of useful to other organisms. Can you think of the way we, humans contribute to the sustenance of ecosystems. Species capture and store energy, produce and decompose organic materials, help to cycle water and nutrients throughout the ecosystem, fix atmospheric gases and help regulate the climate. These functions are important for ecosystem function and human survival. The more diverse an ecosystem, better are the chances for the species to survive through adversities and attacks, and consequently, is more productive. Hence, the loss of species would decrease the ability of the system to maintain itself. Just like a species with a high genetic diversity, an ecosystem with high biodiversity may have a greater chance of adapting to environmental change. In other words, the more the variety of species in an ecosystem, the more stable the ecosystem is likely to be. Economic Role of Biodiversity For all humans, biodiversity is an important resource in their day-to-day life. One important part of biodiversity is ‘crop diversity’, which is also called agro-biodiversity. Biodiversity is seen as a reservoir of resources to be drawn upon for the manufacture of food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic products. This concept of biological resources is responsible for the deterioration of biodiversity. At the same time, it is also the origin of new conﬂicts dealing with rules of division and appropriation of natural resources. Some of the important economic commodities that biodiversity supplies to humankind are: food crops, livestock, forests, fish, medicinal resources, etc. Scientiﬁc Role of Biodiversity Biodiversity is important because each species can give us some clue as to how life evolved and will continue to evolve. Biodiversity also helps in understanding how life functions and the role of each species in sustaining 2019-2020"
biology/,"234 Outer Inner mitochondrial — membrane BIOLOGY transport system is utilised in synthesising ATP with the help of ATP synthase (complex V). This complex consists of two major components, F1 and F0 (Figure 14.5). The F1 headpiece is a peripheral membrane protein complex and contains the site for synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. F0 is an integral membrane protein complex that forms the channel through which protons cross the inner membrane. The passage of protons through the ADP Pi channel is coupled to the catalytic site of the F1 component for the production of ATP. For each ATP produced, 2H+ passes through F0 from the Matrix Figure 14.5 Diagramatic presentation of ATP intermembrane space to the matrix down the synthesis in mitochondria electrochemical proton gradient. 14.5 THE RESPIRATORY BALANCE SHEET It is possible to make calculations of the net gain of ATP for every glucose molecule oxidised; but in reality this can remain only a theoretical exercise. These calculations can be made only on certain assumptions that: ’ There is a sequential, orderly pathway functioning, with one substrate forming the next and with glycolysis, TCA cycle and ETS pathway following one after another. ' The NADH synthesised in glycolysis is transferred into the mitochondria and undergoes oxidative phosphorylation. ' None of the intermediates in the pathway are utilised to synthesise any other compound. ° Only glucose is being respired — no other alternative substrates are entering in the pathway at any of the intermediary stages. But this ldnd of assumptions are not really valid in a living system; all pathways work simultaneously and do not take place one after another; substrates enter the pathways and are withdrawn from it as and when necessary; ATP is utilised as and when needed; enzymatic rates are controlled by multiple means. Yet, it is useful to do this exercise to appreciate the beauty and efﬁciency of the living system in extraction and storing energy. Hence, there can be a net gain of 38 ATP molecules during aerobic respiration of one molecule of glucose."
physics/,"IIO87CHIO CHAPTER TEN MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS Introduction Pressure Streamline ﬂow Bernoulli’s principle Viscosity Surface tension Summary Points to ponder Exercises Additional exercises Appendix 10. 1 INTRODUCTION In this chapter, we shall study some common physical properties of liquids and gases. Liquids and gases can ﬂow and are therefore, called ﬂuids. It is this property that distinguishes liquids and gases from solids in a basic way. Fluids are everywhere around us. Earth has an envelop of air and two-thirds of its surface is covered with water. Water is not only necessary for our existence; every mammalian body constitute mostly of water. All the processes occurring in living beings including plants are mediated by ﬂuids. Thus understanding the behaviour and properties of ﬂuids is important. How are ﬂuids different from solids? What is common in liquids and gases? Unlike a solid, a ﬂuid has no definite shape of its own. Solids and liquids have a fixed volume, whereas a gas fills the entire volume of its container. We have learnt in the previous chapter that the volume of solids can be changed by stress. The volume of solid, liquid or gas depends on the stress or pressure acting on it. When we talk about fixed volume of solid or liquid, we mean its volume under atmospheric pressure. The difference between gases and solids or liquids is that for solids or liquids the change in volume due to change of external pressure is rather small. In other words solids and liquids have much lower compressibility as compared to gases. Shear stress can change the shape of a solid keeping its volume fixed. The key property of ﬂuids is that they offer very little resistance to shear stress; their shape changes by application of very small shear stress. The shearing stress of ﬂuids is about million times smaller than that of solids. 10.2 PRESSURE A sharp needle when pressed against our skin pierces it.

Secondly, there is no well defined plastic region. Substances like tissue of aorta, rubber etc. which can be stretched to cause large strains are called elastomers. 9.6 ELASTIC MODULI The proportional region within the elastic limit of the stress-strain curve (region 0A in Fig. 9.3) is of great importance for structural and manufacturing engineering designs. The ratio of stress and strain, called modulus of elasticity, is found to be a characteristic of the material. 9.6. 1 Young’s Modulus Experimental observation show that for a given material, the magnitude of the strain produced is same whether the stress is tensile or compressive. The ratio of tensile (or compressive) stress (a) to the longitudinal strain (6) is deﬁned as Young’s modulus and is denoted by the symbol Y. O' Y= E (9.7) From Eqs. (9.1) and (9.2), we have Y= (F/AJ/(AL/L) = (Fx L) /(A x AL) (9.8) Since strain is a dimensionless quantity, the unit of Young’s modulus is the same as that of stress i.e., N m—2 or Pascal (Pa). Table 9.1 gives the values of Young’s moduli and yield strengths of some material. From the data given in Table 9. 1, it is noticed that for metals Young’s moduli are large. Therefore, these materials require a large force to produce small change in length. To increase the length of a thin steel wire of 0.1 cm2 cross- sectional area by 0.1%, a force of 2000 N is required. The force required to produce the same strain in aluminium, brass and copper wires having the same cross-sectional area are 690 N, 900 N and 1 100 N respectively. It means that steel is more elastic than copper, brass and aluminium.

geography/,"The term greenhouse is derived from the analogy to a greenhouse used in cold areas for preserving heat. A greenhouse is made up of glass. The glass which is transparent to incoming short wave solar radiation is opaque to outgoing long wave radiation. The glass. therefore. allows in more radiation and prevents the long wave radiation going outside the glass house. causing the temperature inside the glasshouse structure warmer than outside.

geography/,"HOBZCHIO CHAPTER 1@ arlier Chapter 9 described the uneven E distribution of temperature over the surface of the earth. Air expands when heated and gets compressed when cooled. This results in variations in the atmospheric pressure. The result is that it causes the movement of air from high pressure to low pressure, setting the air in motion. You already know that air in horizontal motion is wind. Atmospheric pressure also determines when the air will rise or sink. The wind redistributes the heat and moisture across the planet, thereby, maintaining a constant temperature for the planet as a whole. The vertical rising of moist air cools it down to form the clouds and bring precipitation. This chapter has been devoted to explain the causes of pressure differences, the forces that control the atmospheric circulation, the turbulent pattern of wind, the formation of air masses, the disturbed weather when air masses interact with each other and the phenomenon of violent tropical storms. ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE Do you realise that our body is subjected to a lot of air pressure. As one moves up the air gets varified and one feels breathless. The weight of a column of air contained in a unit area from the mean sea level to the top of the atmosphere is called the atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure is expressed in units of milibar. At sea level the average atmospheric pressure is 1,0 13.2 milibar. Due to gravity the air at the surface is denser and hence has higher pressure. Air ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION AND WEATHER SYSTEMS pressure is measured with the help of a mercury barometer or the aneroid barometer. Consult your book, Practical Work in Geography — Part I (NCERT, 2006) and learn about these instruments. The pressure decreases with height. At any elevation it varies from place to place and its variation is the primary cause of air motion, i.e. wind which moves from high pressure areas to low pressure areas. Vertical Variation of Pressure In the lower atmosphere the pressure decreases rapidly with height. The decrease amounts to about 1 mb for each 10 m increase in elevation. It does not always decrease at the same rate. Table 10.1 gives the average pressure and temperature at selected levels of elevation for a standard atmosphere.

But, it is generally balanced by a nearly equal but opposite gravitational force. Hence, we do not experience strong upward winds. 2019-2020"

biology/,"164 You have studied mitosis in onion root tip cells. It has 16 chromosomes in each cell. Can you tell how many chromosomes will the cell have at G1 phase, after S phase, and after M phase? Also, what will be the DNA content of the cells at G1, after S and at G2, if the content after M phase is 2C? BiowGY Some cells in the adult animals do not appear to exhibit division (e.g., heart cells) and many other cells divide only occasionally, as needed to replace cells that have been lost because of injury or cell death. These cells that do not divide further exit G1 phase to enter an inactive stage called quiescent stage (Go) of the cell cycle. Cells in this stage remain metabolically active but no longer proliferate unless called on to do so depending on the requirement of the organism. In animals, mitotic cell division is only seen in the diploid somatic cells. However, there are few exceptions to this where haploid cells divide by mitosis, for example, male honey bees. Against this, the plants can show mitotic divisions in both haploid and diploid cells. From your recollection of examples of alternation of generations in plants (Chapter 3) identify plant species and stages at which mitosis is seen in haploid cells. 10.2 M PHASE This is the most dramatic period of the cell cycle, involving a major reorganisation of virtually all components of the cell. Since the number of chromosomes in the parent and progeny cells is the same, it is also called as equational division. Though for convenience mitosis has been divided into four stages of nuclear division (karyokinesis), it is very essential to understand that cell division is a progressive process and very clear-cut lines cannot be drawn between various stages. Karyokinesis involves following four stages: 0 Prophase o Metaphase o Anaphase o Telophase 1 0.2.1 Prophase Prophase which is the first stage of karyokinesis of mitosis follows the S and G2 phases of interphase. In the S and G2 phases the new DNA molecules formed are not distinct but intertwined. Prophase is marked by the initiation of condensation of chromosomal material. The chromosomal material becomes untangled during the process of chromatin condensation (Figure 10.2 a). The centrosome, which had undergone duplication during S phase of interphase, now begins to move towards opposite poles of the cell. The completion of prophase can thus be marked by the following characteristic events: 0 Chromosomal material condenses to form compact mitotic chromosomes. Chromosomes are seen to be composed of two chromatids attached together at the centromere. O Centrosome which had undergone duplication during interphase, begins to move towards opposite poles of the cell. Each centrosome radiates out microtubules called asters. The two asters together with spindle fibres forms mitotic apparatus. 2019-2020"

From Eq. (7 .45c), if the external torque is zero, LZ = Ia) = constant (7 .46) For symmetric bodies, from Eq. (7 .44d), Lz may be replaced by L .(L and LZ are respectively the magnitudes of L and L2.) This then is the required form, for fixed axis rotation, of Eq. (7 .29a), which expresses the general law of conservation of angular momentum of a system of particles. Eq. (7 .46) applies to many situations that we come across in daily life. You may do this experiment with your friend. Sit on a swivel chair (a chair with a seat, free to rotate about a pivot) with your arms folded and feet not resting on, i.e., away from, the ground. Ask your friend to rotate the chair rapidly. While the chair is rotating with Fig 7.36 (a) A demonstration of conservation of angular momentum A girl sits on a swivel chair and stretches her arms/ brings her arms closer to the body. considerable angular speed stretch your arms horizontally. What happens? Your angular speed is reduced. If you bring back your arms closer to your body, the angular speed increases again. This is a situation where the principle of conservation of angular momentum is applicable. If friction in the rotational mechanism is neglected, there is no external torque about the axis of rotation of the chair and hence Ice is constant. Stretching the arms increases I about the axis of rotation, resulting in decreasing the angular speed a). Bringing the arms closer to the body has the opposite effect. A circus acrobat and a diver take advantage of this principle. Also, skaters and classical, Indian or western, dancers performing a pirouette (a spinning about a tip—top) on the toes of one foot display ‘mastery’ over this principle. Can you explain? 7. 14 ROLLING MOTION One of the most common motions observed in daily life is the rolling motion. All wheels used in transportation have rolling motion.

These are generally repetitive in nature. If all these payments are handled by the cashier and are recorded in the main cash book, the procedure is found to be very cumbersome. The cashier may be overburdened and the cash book may become very bulky. To avoid this, large organisations normally appoint one more cashier (petty cashier) and maintain a separate cash book to record these transactions. Such a cash book maintained by petty cashier is called petty cash book. The petty cashier works on the Imprest system. Under this system, a deﬁnite sum, say ? 2,000 is given to the petty cashier at the beginning of a certain period. This amount is called imprest amount.

biology/,"NEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION Sense Organs We smell things by our nose, taste by tongue, hear by ear and see objects by eyes. The nose contains mucus-coated receptors which are specialised for receiving the sense of smell and called olfactory receptors. These are made up of olfactory epithelium that consists of three kinds of cells. The neurons of the olfactory epithelium extend from the outside environment directly into a pair of broad bean-sized organs, called olfactory bulb, which are extensions of the brain’s limbic system. Both nose and tongue detect dissolved chemicals. The chemical senses of gustation (taste) and olfactory (smell) are functionally similar and interrelated. The tongue detects tastes through taste buds, containing gustatory receptors. With each taste of food or sip of drink, the brain integrates the differential input from the taste buds and a complex ﬂavour is perceived. In the following sections, you will be introduced to the structure and functioning of the eye (sensory organ for vision) and the ear (sensory organ for hearing). 21.6.1 Eye Our paired eyes are located in sockets of the skull called orbits.

This list may have water, oxygen and nutrients as very essential elements for growth. The plant cells grow in size by cell enlargement which in turn requires water. Turgidity of cells helps in extension growth. Thus, plant growth and further development is intimately linked to the water status of the plant. Water also provides the medium for enzymatic activities needed for growth. Oxygen helps in releasing metabolic energy essential for growth activities. Nutrients (macro and micro essential elements) are required by plants for the synthesis of protoplasm and act as source of energy. In addition, every plant organism has an optimum temperature range best suited for its growth. Any deviation from this range could be detrimental to its survival. Environmental signals such as light and gravity also affect certain phases/ stages of growth."

It controls the voluntary movements, balance of the body, functioning of vital involuntary organs (e. g., lungs, heart, kidneys, etc.), thermoregulation, hunger and thirst, circadian (24-hour) rhythms of our body, activities of several endocrine glands and human behaviour.

biology/,"188 BIOLOGY The transpiration driven ascent of xylem sap depends mainly on the following physical properties of water: ° Cohesion — mutual attraction between water molecules. ° Adhesion — attraction of water molecules to polar surfaces (such as the surface of tracheary elements). ° Surface Tension — water molecules are attracted to each other in the liquid phase more than to water in the gas phase. These properties give water high tensile strength, i.e., an ability to resist a pulling force, and high capillarity, i.e., the ability to rise in thin tubes. In plants capillarity is aided by the small diameter of the tracheary elements — the tracheids and vessel elements. The process of photosynthesis requires water. The system of xylem vessels from the root to the leaf vein can supply the needed water. But what force does a plant use to move water molecules into the leaf parenchyma cells where they are needed? As water evaporates through the stomata, since the thin film of water over the cells is continuous, it results in pulling of water, molecule by molecule, into the leaf from the xylem. Also, because of lower concentration of water vapour in the atmosphere as compared to the substomatal cavity and intercellular spaces, water diffuses into the surrounding air. This creates a ‘pull’ (Figure 1 1.9). Measurements reveal that the forces generated by transpiration can create pressures sufﬁcient to lift a xylem sized column of water over 130 metres high.

The centre of mass moves as if all the mass of the system is concentrated at this point and all the extemal forces act at it.

Pressure potential is usually positive, though in plants negative potential or tension in the water column in the xylem plays a major role in water transport up a stem. Pressure potential is denoted as ‘I‘p. Water potential of a cell is affected by both solute and pressure potential. The relationship between them is as follows: A 1 1 .2.2 Osmosis The plant cell is surrounded by a cell membrane and a cell wall. The cell wall is freely permeable to water and substances in solution hence is not a barrier to movement. In plants the cells usually contain a large central vacuole, whose contents, the vacuolar sap, contribute to the solute potential of the cell. In plant cells, the cell membrane and the membrane of the vacuole, the tonoplast together are important determinants of movement of molecules in or out of the cell. Osmosis is the term used to refer speciﬁcally to the diffusion of water across a differentially- or selectively permeable membrane. Osmosis occurs spontaneously in response to a driving force. The net direction and rate of osmosis depends on both the pressure gradient and concentration gradient. Water will move from its region of higher chemical potential (or concentration) to its region of lower chemical potential until equilibrium is reached. At equilibrium the two chambers should have nearly the same water potential. You may have made a potato osmometer in your earlier classes in school.

In all connective tissues except blood, the cells secrete ﬁbres of structural proteins called collagen or elastin. The fibres provide strength, elasticity and ﬂexibility to the tissue. These cells also secrete modified polysaccharides, which accumulate between cells and fibres and act as matrix (ground substance). Connective tissues are classified into three types: (i) Loose connective tissue, (ii) Dense connective tissue and (iii) Specialised connective tissue. Loose connective tissue has cells and fibres loosely arranged in a semi-ﬂuid ground substance, for example, areolar tissue present beneath the skin (Figure 7.4). Often it serves as a support framework for epithelium. It contains fibroblasts (cells that produce and secrete ﬁbres), macrophages and mast cells. Adipose tissue is another type of loose connective tissue located mainly beneath the skin. The cells of this tissue are specialised to store fats.

The position of P’ on the x—aXis, as the particle P moves on the circle, is given by x(t) = A cos (wt+ ¢) which is the defining equation of SHM. This shows that if P moves uniformly on a circle, its projection P’ on a diameter of the circle executes SHM. The particle P and the circle on which it moves are sometimes referred to as the reference particle and the reference circle, respectively. We can take projection of the motion of P on any diameter, say the y-axis. In that case. the displacement y(t) of P’ on the y-axis is given by y=Asin (cot+ (1)) which is also an SHM of the same amplitude as that of the projection on x-axis, but differing by a phase of 7r/2.

Angle is a dimensionless quantity. Therefore it is not always necessary to mention the unit ‘radian’ when we use 7:, its multiples or submultiples. The conversion between radian and degree is not similar to that between metre and centimetre or mile. If the argument of a trigonometric function is stated without units, it is understood that the unit is radian. On the other hand, if degree is to be used as the unit of angle, then it must be shown explicitly. For example, sin(1 50) means sine of 1 5 degree, but sin(1 5) means sine of 1 5 radians. Hereafter, we will often drop ‘rad’ as the unit, and it should be understood that whenever angle is mentioned as a numerical value, without units, it is to be taken as radians. 2019-20"

Calculations for a fatty acid, tripalmitin, if used as a substrate is shown: When proteins are respiratory substrates the ratio would be about 0.9. What is important to recognise is that in living organisms respiratory substrates are often more than one; pure proteins or fats are never used as respiratory substrates. SUMMARY Plants unlike animals have no special systems for breathing or gaseous exchange. Stomata and lenticels allow gaseous exchange by diffusion. Almost all living cells in a plant have their surfaces exposed to air. The breaking of C- C bonds of complex organic molecules by oxidation cells leading to the release of a lot of ener‘r is called cellular respiration. Glucose 1s the favoured substrate for respiration. Fats and proteins can also be broken down to yield energy. The initial stage'z'of cellular respiration takes place in the cytoplasm. Each glucose moleculefisbmken through a series of enzyme catalysed reactions into two molecules of pyruVic acid. This process is called glycolysis. The fate of the pyruvate depends‘on the availability of oxygen and the organism. Under anaerobic conditions eithei‘r, lactic acid fermentation or alcohol fermentation occurs. Fermentation takes place under anaerobic conditions in many prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes and in germinating seeds. In eukaryotic organisms aerobic respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen. Pyruvic acid is transported into the mitochondria where it is converted into acetyl CoA with the release of C02. Acetyl CoA then enters the tricarboxylic acid pathway or Krebs’ cycle operating in the matrix of the mitochondria. NADH + H’“ and FADH2 are generated in the Krebs’ cycle. The energy in these molecules as well as that in the NADH + H” synthesised during glycolysis are used to synthesise ATP. This is accomplished through a 237"

biology/,"176 BIOLOGY compounds synthesised in the photosynthetic leaves are exported to all other parts of the plant including storage organs. From the storage organs they are later re-exported. The mineral nutrients are taken up by the roots and transported upwards into the stem, leaves and the growing regions. When any plant part undergoes senescence, nutrients may be withdrawn from such regions and moved to the growing parts. Hormones or plant growth regulators and other chemical signals are also transported, though in very small amounts, sometimes in a strictly polarised or unidirectional manner from where they are synthesised to other parts. Hence, in a ﬂowering plant there is a complex trafﬁc of compounds (but probably very orderly) moving in different directions, each organ receiving some substances and giving out some others. 1 1. 1 MEANS OF TRANSPORT 1 1 . 1 . 1 Diffusion Movement by diffusion is passive, and may be from one part of the cell to the other, or from cell to cell, or over short distances, say, from the inter- cellular spaces of the leaf to the outside. No energy expenditure takes place. In diffusion, molecules move in a random fashion, the net result being substances moving from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration. Diffusion is a slow process and is not dependent on a ‘living system’. Diffusion is obvious in gases and liquids, but diffusion in solids is more likely rather than of solids. Diffusion is very important to plants since it is the only means for gaseous movement within the plant body. Diffusion rates are affected by the gradient of concentration, the permeability of the membrane separating them, temperature and pressure. 1 l. 1.2 Facilitated Diffusion As pointed out earlier, a gradient must already be present for diffusion to occur. The diffusion rate depends on the size of the substances; obviously smaller substances difﬁise faster. The diffusion of any substance across a membrane also depends on its solubility in lipids, the major constituent of the membrane. Substances soluble in lipids diffuse through the membrane faster. Substances that have a hydrophilic moiety, ﬁnd it difﬁcult to pass through the membrane; their movement has to be facilitated. Membrane proteins provide sites at which such molecules cross the membrane. They do not set up a concentration gradient: a concentration gradient must already be present for molecules to diffuse even if facilitated by the proteins. This process is called facilitated diffusion. In facilitated diffusion special proteins help move substances across membranes without expenditure of ATP energy. Facilitated diffusion cannot cause net transport of molecules from a low to a high concentration — this would require input of energy. Transport rate reaches a maximum when all of the protein transporters are being used (saturation). Facilitated"

Further, v is tangential at P to the circle which the particle describes. Using the right-hand rule one can check that Cva is parallel to the fixed axis. The unit vector along the fixed axis (chosen as the z—axis) is 1; . Hence /\ CP><mv=rl(mv)k = mrfw’ﬁ (since v: 6011) Similarly, we can check that 00 Xv is perpendicular to the fixed axis.

In general, for a particle, the angular momentum l is not along the axis of rotation, i.e. for a particle, l and a) are not necessarily parallel. Compare this with the corresponding fact in translation. For a particle, p and v are always parallel to each other. For computing the total angular momentum of the whole rigid body, we add up the contribution of each particle of the body. Thus L=Zli=21iz +20Ci xmivi We denote by L i and LZ the components of L respectively perpendicular to the z—axis and along the z-axis; Li = Z 00, x mivi (7.44a) where m. and vi are respectively the mass and the velocity of the Eh particle and C1 is the centre of the circle described by the particle; and Lz=zliz=[z mirizjwk or L2 2 leaf: (7.44b) The last step follows since the perpendicular distance of the {“1 particle from the axis is r1; and by definition the moment of inertia of the body about the axis of rotation is I = 2 min? . 2019-20 Note L =LZ + Ll (7.44c) The rigid bodies which we have mainly considered in this chapter are symmetric about the axis of rotation, i.e. the axis of rotation is one of their symmetry axes. For such bodies, for a given 00‘, for every particle which has a velocity vi , there is another particle of velocity —vi located diametrically opposite on the circle with centre Ci described by the particle. Together such pairs will contribute zero to L l and as a result for symmetric bodies L i is zero, and hence L = L2 = Ian? (7.44d) For bodies, which are not symmetric about the axis of rotation, L is not equal to L2 and hence L does not lie along the axis of rotation.

physics/,"190 PHYSICS 4—Earth’s surface Fig. 8. 7 The mass m is in a mine located at a depth d below the surface of the Earth of mass ME and radius RE. We treat the Earth to be spherically symmetric. Again consider the earth to be made up of concentric shells as before and a point mass m situated at a distance r from the centre. The point P lies outside the sphere of radius r. For the shells of radius greater than r, the point P lies inside. Hence according to result stated in the last section, they exert no gravitational force on mass m kept at P. The shells with radius 3 r make up a sphere of radius r for which the point P lies on the surface. This smaller sphere therefore exerts a force on a mass m at P as if its mass Mris concentrated at the centre. Thus the force on the mass m at P has a magnitude Gm (Mr) F = —2 (8.9) r We assume that the entire earth is of uniform 47; density and hence its mass is ME = g R: p where ME is the mass of the earth RE is its radius and p is the density.

In higher classes, you will be told that there are more than a dozen forms of DNA named after English alphabets with unique structural features. 9.9 DYNAMIC STATE OF BODY CONSTITUENTS - CONCEPT OF METABOLISM What we have learnt till now is that living organisms, be it a simple bacterial cell, a protozoan, a plant or an animal, contain thousands of organic compounds. These compounds or biomolecules are present in certain concentrations (expressed as mols / cell or mols / litre etc.). One of the greatest discoveries ever made was the observation that all these biomolecules have a turn over. This means that they are constantly being changed into some other biomolecules and also made from some other biomolecules. This breaking and making is through chemical reactions constantly occuring in living organisms. Together all these chemical reactions are called metabolism. Each of the metabolic reactions results in the transformation Of biomolecules. A few examples for such metabolic transformations are: removal of CO2 from amino acids making an amino acid into an amine, removal of amino group in a nucleotide base; hydrolysis of a glycosidic bond in a disaccharide, etc. We can list tens and thousands of such examples. Majority of these metabolic reactions do not occur in isolation but are always linked to some other reactions. In other words, metabolites are converted into each other in a series of linked reactions called metabolic pathways. These metabolic pathways are similar to the automobile trafﬁc in a city. These pathways are either linear or circular. These pathways criss- cross each other, i.e., there are trafﬁc junctions. Flow of metabolites through metabolic pathway has a deﬁnite rate and direction like automobile traffic. This metabolite ﬂow is called the dynamic state of body constituents. What is most important is that this interlinked metabolic trafﬁc is very smooth and without a single reported mishap for healthy conditions. Another feature of these metabolic reactions is that every chemical reaction is a catalysed reaction. There is no uncatalysed metabolic conversion in living systems. Even CO2 dissolving in water, a physical process, is a catalysed reaction in living systems. The catalysts which hasten the rate of a given metabolic conversation are also proteins. These proteins with catalytic power are named enzymes."
biology/,"340 BIOLOGY physiological functions are regulated by hormones. On the basis of their chemical nature, hormones can be divided into groups : (i) peptide, polypeptide, protein hormones (e.g., insulin, glucagon, pituitary hormones, hypothalamic hormones, etc.) (ii) steroids (e.g., cortisol, testosterone, estradiol and progesterone) (iii) iodothyronines (thyroid hormones) (iv) amino-acid derivatives (e.g., epinephrine). Hormones which interact with membrane-bound receptors normally do not enter the target cell, but generate second messengers (e. g., cyclic AMP, 1P3, Ca“ etc) which in turn regulate cellular metabolism (Figure 22.5a). Hormones which interact with intracellular receptors (e. g., steroid hormones, iodothyronines, etc.) mostly regulate gene expression or chromosome function by the interaction of hormone-receptor complex with the genome.

physics/,"94 PHYSICS this hurts.The conclusion is clear: force not only depends on the change in momentum, but also on how fast the change is brought about. The same change in momentum brought about in a shorter time needs a greater applied force. In short, the greater the rate of change of momentum, the greater is the force. Fig. 5.3 Force not only depends on the change in momentum but also on how fast the change is brought about. A seasoned cricketer draws in his hands during a catch, allowing greater time for the ball to stop and hence requires a smaller force. ' Observations confirm that the product of mass and velocity (i.e. momentum) is basic to the effect of force on motion. Suppose a fixed force is applied for a certain interval of time on two bodies of different masses, initially at rest, the lighter body picks up a greater speed than the heavier body. However, at the end of the time interval, observations show that each body acquires the same momentum. Thus the same force for the same time causes the same change in momentum for different bodies. This is a crucial clue to the second law of motion. ' In the preceding observations, the vector character of momentum has not been evident. In the examples so far, momentum and change in momentum both have the same direction. But this is not always the case. Suppose a stone is rotated with uniform speed in a horizontal plane by means of a string, the magnitude of momentum is fixed, but its direction changes (Fig. 5.4). A force is needed to cause this change in momentum vector. 2019-20 This force is provided by our hand through the string. Experience suggests that our hand needs to exert a greater force if the stone is rotated at greater speed or in a circle of smaller radius, or both. This corresponds to greater acceleration or equivalently a greater rate of change in momentum vector. This suggests that the greater the rate of change in momentum vector the greater is the force applied. Fig. 5.4 Force is necessary for changing the direction of momentum, even if its magnitude is constant. We can feel this while rotating a stone in a horizontal circle with unifomi speed by means of a string. These qualitative observations lead to the second law of motion expressed by Newton as follows: The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts. Thus, if under the action of a force F for time interval At, the velocity of a body of mass m changes from v to v + Av i.e. its initial momentum p = m v changes by Ap = mAv . According to the Second Law, Focﬂ or F =kA—P At At where k is a constant of proportionality. Taking the limit At —> O, the term ﬂ becomes the At derivative or differential co-efficient of p with respect to t, denoted by % . Thus"
biology/,"RESPIRATION IN PLANTS carbohydrates. Sucrose is converted into glucose and fructose by the enzyme, invertase, and these two monosaccharides readily enter the glycolytic pathway. Glucose and fructose are phosphorylated to give rise to glucose-6- phosphate by the activity of the enzyme hexokinase. This phosphorylated form of glucose then isomerises to produce fructose-6- phosphate. Subsequent steps of metabolism of glucose and ﬁ‘uctose are same. The various steps of glycolysis are depicted in Figure 14.1. In glycolysis, a chain of ten reactions, under the control of different enzymes, takes place to produce pyruvate from glucose. While studying the steps of glycolysis, please note the steps at which utilisation or synthesis of AT P or (in this case) NADH + H+ take place. ATP is utilised at two steps: ﬁrst in the conversion of glucose into glucose 6-phosphate and second in the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate. The fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate is split into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL). We find that there is one step where NADH + H+ is formed from NAD+; this is when 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) is converted to 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPGA). Two redox—equivalents are removed (in the form of two hydrogen atoms) from PGAL and transferred to a molecule of NAD+. PGAL is oxidised and with inorganic phosphate to get converted into BPGA. The conversion of BPGA to 3-phosphoglyceric acid (PGA), is also an energy yielding process; this energy is trapped by the formation of ATP. Another ATP is synthesised during the conversion of PEP to pyruvic acid. Can you then calculate how many ATP molecules are directly synthesised in this pathway from one glucose molecule? Pyruvic acid is then the key product of glycolysis. What is the metabolic fate of pyruvate?

Answer The range of variation over the seven days of observations is 162 s for clock 1, and 3 1 s for clock 2. The average reading of clock 1 is much closer to the standard time than the average reading of clock 2. The important point is that a clock’s zero error is not as significant for precision work as its variation, because a ‘zero-error’ can always be easily corrected. Hence clock 2 is to be preferred to clock 1. 4 Example 2.7 We measure the period of oscillation of a simple pendulum.

The arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors (for arithmetic mean, we take only the magnitudes) is ATmem = [(0.01+ 0.06+0.20+0.09+0.18)s]/5 = 0.54 s/5 = 0.1 1 s That means, the period of oscillation of the simple pendulum is (2.62 i 0.11) s i.e. it lies between (2.62 + 0.11) s and (2.62 — 0.11) s or between 2.73 s and 2.51 s. As the arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors is 0.1 1 s, there is already an error in the tenth of a second. Hence there is no point in giving the period to a hundredth. A more correct way will be to write T=2.6i0.1 S Note that the last numeral 6 is unreliable, since it may be anything between 5 and 7. We indicate this by saying that the measurement has two significant figures. In this case, the two significant figures are 2, which is reliable and 6, which has an error associated with it.

The inner compartment is filled with a dense homogeneous substance called the matrix. The outer membrane forms the continuous limiting boundary of the organelle. The inner membrane forms a number of infoldings called the cristae (sing.: crista) towards the matrix (Figure 8.7). The cristae increase the surface area. The two membranes have their own specific enzymes associated with the mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are the sites of aerobic respiration. They produce cellular energy in the form of ATP, hence they are called ‘power houses’ of the cell. The matrix also possesses single circular DNA molecule, a few RNA molecules, ribosomes (7 OS) and the components required for the synthesis of proteins. The mitochondria divide by fission. 8. 5.5 Plastids Plastids are found in all plant cells and in euglenoides. These are easily observed under the microscope as they are large. They bear some speciﬁc pigments, thus imparting specific colours to the plants. Based on the type of pigments plastids can be classified into chloroplasts, chromoplasts and leucoplasts.

It is also called the modulus of rigidity. G = shearing stress (as) / shearing strain G = (F/AJ/(AX/L) = (FxL)/(A><Ax) (9.10) Similarly, from Eq.

This leads to the decrease in the volume of the body thus producing a strain called volume strain [Eq. (9.5)]. The ratio of hydraulic stress to the corresponding hydraulic strain is called bulk modulus. It is denoted by symbol B. B=-P/(AV/V) (9.13) The negative sign indicates the fact that with an increase in pressure, a decrease in volume occurs. That is, if p is positive, AV is negative. Thus for a system in equilibrium, the value of bulk modulus B is always positive. SI unit of bulk modulus is the same as that of pressure i.e., N m‘2 or Pa. The bulk moduli of a few common materials are given in Table 9.3. The reciprocal of the bulk modulus is called compressibility and is denoted by k. It is defined as the fractional change in volume per unit increase in pressure. k=(1/B)=-(1/AP)><(AV/V) (9.14) It can be seen from the data given in Table 9.3 that the bulk moduli for solids are much larger than for liquids, which are again much larger than the bulk modulus for gases (air)."

Anatomically, the ear can be divided into three major sections called the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear (Figure 2 1.7). The outer ear consists of the pinna and external _ Temporal bone auditory meatus (canal). “ The pinna collects the vibrations in the air which produce sound. The external auditory meatus leads inwards and extends up to the tympanic nerve membrane (the ear drum). There are very ﬁne hairs and Cochlea wax-secretin lands in the ' . g.g External ’I‘ympamc sk1n of the pinna and the . membrane , auditory Eustachian meatus. The tympanic canal tube membrane is composed of connective tissues covered Figure 21.7 Diagrammatic view of ear with skin outside and with mucus membrane inside. The middle ear contains three ossicles called malleus, incus and stapes which are attached to one another in a chain-like fashion. The malleus is attached to the tympanic membrane and the stapes is attached to the oval window of the cochlea. The ear ossicles increase the efﬁciency of transmission of sound waves to the inner ear. An Eustachian tube connects the middle ear cavity with the pharynx. The Eustachian tube helps in equalising the pressures on either sides of the ear drum. The ﬂuid-ﬁlled inner ear called labyrinth consists of two parts, the bony and the membranous labyrinths. The bony labyrinth is a series of channels. Inside these channels lies the membranous labyrinth, which is surrounded by a ﬂuid called perilymph. The membranous labyrinth is ﬁlled with a ﬂuid called endolymph. The coiled portion of the labyrinth is called cochlea. The membranes constituting cochlea, the reissner’s and basilar, divide the surounding perilymph ﬁlled bony labyrinth into an upper scala vestibuli and a lower scala tympani (Figure 2 1.8).

biology/,"BIOLOGY grows by cell division. In plants, this growth by cell division occurs continuously throughout their life span. In animals, this growth is seen only up to a certain age. However, cell division occurs in certain tissues to replace lost cells. Unicellular organisms grow by cell division. One can easily observe this in in vitro cultures by simply counting the number of cells under the microscope. In majority of higher animals and plants, growth and reproduction are mutually exclusive events. One must remember that increase in body mass is considered as growth. Non-living objects also grow if we take increase in body mass as a criterion for growth. Mountains, boulders and sand mounds do grow. However, this kind of growth exhibited by non-living objects is by accumulation of material on the surface. In living organisms, growth is from inside. Growth, therefore, cannot be taken as a deﬁning property of living organisms. Conditions under which it can be observed in all living organisms have to be explained and then we understand that it is a characteristic of living systems. A dead organism does not grow. Reproduction, likewise, is a characteristic of living organisms. In multicellular organisms, reproduction refers to the production of progeny possessing features more or less similar to those of parents. Invariably and implicitly we refer to sexual reproduction. Organisms reproduce by asexual means also. Fungi multiply and spread easily due to the millions of asexual spores they produce. In lower organisms like yeast and hydra, we observe budding. In Planaria (ﬂat worms), we observe true regeneration, i.e., a fragmented organism regenerates the lost part of its body and becomes, a new organism. The fungi, the ﬁlamentous algae, the protonema of mosses, all easily multiply by fragmentation. When it comes to unicellular organisms like bacteria, unicellular algae or Amoeba, reproduction is synonymous with growth, i.e., increase in number of cells. We have already deﬁned growth as equivalent to increase in cell number or mass. Hence, we notice that in single-celled organisms, we are not very clear about the usage of these two terms — growth and reproduction. Further, there are many organisms which do not reproduce (mules, sterile worker bees, infertile human couples, etc). Hence, reproduction also cannot be an all-inclusive deﬁning characteristic of living organisms. Of course, no non-living object is capable of reproducing or replicating by itself. Another characteristic of life is metabolism. All living organisms are made of chemicals. These chemicals, small and big, belonging to various classes, sizes, functions, etc., are constantly being made and changed into some other biomolecules. These conversions are chemical reactions or metabolic reactions. There are thousands of metabolic reactions occurring simultaneously inside all living organisms, be they"

W The work done by a conservative force such as gravity depends on the initial and final positions only. In the previous chapter we have worked on examples dealing with inclined planes. If an object of mass m is released from rest, from the top of a smooth (frictionless) inclined plane of height h, its speed at the bottom is 29h irrespective of the angle of inclination. Thus, at the bottom of the inclined plane it acquires a kinetic energy, mgh. If the work done or the kinetic energy did depend on other factors such as the velocity or the particular path taken by the object, the force would be called non- conservative. The dimensions of potential energy are [MLZT ’2] and the unit is joule (J), the same as kinetic energy or work. To reiterate, the change in potential energy, for a conservative force, AV is equal to the negative of the work done by the force AV = — FIX) Ax (6.9) In the example of the falling ball considered in this section we saw how potential energy was converted to kinetic energy. This hints at an important principle of conservation in mechanics, which we now proceed to examine. 6.8 THE CONSERVATION 0F MECHANICAL ENERGY For simplicity we demonstrate this important principle for one-dimensional motion. Suppose that a body undergoes displacement Ax under the action of a conservative force F. Then from the WE theorem we have, AK = Rx) Ax If the force is conservative, the potential energy function V(x) can be defined such that — AV = Rx) Ax The above equations imply that AK + AV = O A(K + V) = O (6.10) which means that K + V, the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the body is a constant. Over the whole path, xi to X], this means that K, + V(xi) = Kf + V(xf) (6.1 l) The quantity K +V(x), is called the total mechanical energy of the system. Individually the kinetic energy K and the potential energy V(x) may vary from point to point, but the sum is a constant. The aptness of the term ‘conservative force’ is now clear. Let us consider some of the definitions of a conservative force. 0 A force FIX) is conservative if it can be derived from a scalar quantity V(x) by the relation given by Eq. (6.9). The three-dimensional generalisation requires the use of a vector derivative, which is outside the scope of this book. 0 The work done by the conservative force depends only on the end points. This can be seen from the relation, W = Kf— Ki = V(xi) — V(xf) which depends on the end points. 0 A third definition states that the work done by this force in a closed path is zero. This is once again apparent from Eq. (6.1 1) since xi = xf_ Thus, the principle of conservation of total mechanical energy can be stated as The total mechanical energy of a system is conserved if the forces, doing work on it, are conservative. The above discussion can be made more concrete by considering the example of the gravitational force once again and that of the spring force in the next section.

However, as stated earlier, the agreement of trial balance is not an absolute proof of accuracy of accounting records. A tallied trial balance only proves, to a certain extent, that the posting to the ledger is arithmetically correct. But it does not guarantee that the entry itself is correct. There can be errors, which affect the equality of debits and credits, and there can be errors, which do not affect the equality of debits and credits. Some common errors include the following: 0 Error in totalling of the debit and credit balances in the trial balance. 0 Error in totalling of subsidiary books. 0 Error in posting of the total of subsidiary books. 0 Error in showing account balances in wrong column of the tiral balance, or in the wrong amount. 0 Omission in showing an account balance in the trial balance. 0 Error in the calculation of a ledger account balance. 0 Error while posting a journal entry: a j ournal entry may not have been posted properly to the ledger, i.e., posting made either with wrong amount or on the wrong side of the account or in the wrong account. 0 Error in recording a transaction in the journal: making a reverse entry, i.e., account to be debited is credited and amount to be credited is debited, or an entry with wrong amount. 0 Error in recording a transaction in subsidiary book with wrong name or wrong amount. 6.4.1 Classiﬁcation of Errors Keeping in view the nature of errors, all the errors can be classified into the following four categories: 0 Errors of Commission 0 Errors of Omission 0 Errors of Principle ° Compensating Errors 6.4.2 Errors of Commission These are the errors which are committed due to wrong posting of transactions, wrong totalling or wrong balancing of the accounts, wrong casting of the subsidiary books, or wrong recording of amount in the books of original entry, etc. For example: Raj Hans Traders paid ? 25,000 to Preetpal Traders (a supplier of goods).

It is absorbed mainly as NO; though some are also taken up as NO; or NH 4"". Nitrogen is required by all parts of a plant, particularly the meristematic tissues and the metabolically active cells. Nitrogen is one of the major constituents of proteins, nucleic acids, vitamins and hormones. Phosphorus: Phosphorus is absorbed by the plants from soil in the form of phosphate ions (either as HZPO:1 or HPOZ‘ ). Phosphorus is a constituent of cell membranes, certain proteins, all nucleic acids and nucleotides, and is required for all phosphorylation reactions. Potassium: It is absorbed as potassium ion (K+). In plants, this is required in more abundant quantities in the meristematic tissues, buds, leaves and root tips. Potassium helps to maintain an anion-cation balance in cells and is involved in protein synthesis, opening and closing of stomata, activation of enzymes and in the maintenance of the turgidity of cells. Calcium: Plant absorbs calcium from the soil in the form of calcium ions (Ca2+). Calcium is required by meristematic and differentiating tissues. During cell division it is used in the synthesis of cell wall, particularly as calcium pectate in the middle lamella. It is also needed during the formation of mitotic spindle. It accumulates in older leaves. It is involved in the normal functioning of the cell membranes. It activates certain enzymes and plays an important role in regulating metabolic activities. Magnesium: It is absorbed by plants in the form of divalent Mg”. It activates the enzymes of respiration, photosynthesis and are involved in the synthesis of DNA and RNA. Magnesium is a constituent of the ring structure of chlorophyll and helps to maintain the ribosome structure. Sulphur: Plants obtain sulphur in the form of sulphate (SOZ‘) . Sulphur is present in two amino acids — cysteine and methionine and is the main constituent of several coenzymes, vitamins (thiamine, biotin, Coenzyme A) and ferredoxin. Iron: Plants obtain iron in the form of ferric ions (Fe3+). It is required in larger amounts in comparison to other micronutrients. It is an important constituent of proteins involved in the transfer of electrons like ferredoxin and cytochromes. It is reversibly oxidised from Fe2+ to Fe3+ during electron transfer. It activates catalase enzyme, and is essential for the formation of chlorophyll. 197"

This change is due to competition where the secondary forest species such as grasses, bamboos or pines overtakes the native species changing the original forest structure. This is called succession.

Human interference has affected the balance of plant communities leading to disturbances in the ecosystems. Such disturbances bring about numerous secondary successions. Human pressure on the earth’s resources has put a heavy toll on 129 the ecosystem. This has destroyed its originality and has caused adverse effects to the general environment.

biology/,"PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT Thus, growth, differentiation and development are very closely related events in the life of a plant. Broadly, development is considered as the sum of growth and differentiation. Development in plants (i.e., both growth and differentiation) is under the control of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The former includes both intracellular (genetic) or intercellular factors (chemicals such as plant growth regulators) while the latter includes light, temperature, water, oxygen, nutrition, etc. 15.4 PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS 15.4. 1 Characteristics The plant growth regulators (PGRs) are small, simple molecules of diverse chemical composition. They could be indole compounds (indole-3-acetic acid, 1AA); adenine derivatives (Ne-furfurylamino purine, kinetin), derivatives of carotenoids (abscisic acid, ABA); terpenes (gibberellic acid, GA3) or gases (ethylene, CZH4). Plant growth regulators are variously described as plant growth substances, plant hormones or phytohormones in literature. The PGRs can be broadly divided into two groups based on their functions in a living plant body. One group of PGRs are involved in growth promoting activities, such as cell division, cell enlargement, pattern formation, tropic growth, ﬂowering, fruiting and seed formation. These are also called plant growth promoters, e.g., auxins, gibberellins and cytokinins. The PGRs of the other group play an important role in plant responses to wounds and stresses of biotic and abiotic origin. They are also involved in various growth inhibiting activities such as dormancy and abscission. ’Ihe PGR abscisic acid belongs to this group. The gaseous PGR, ethylene, could ﬁt either of the groups, but it is largely an inhibitor of grth activities. 15.4.2 The Discovery of Plant Growth Regulators Interestingly, the discovery of each of the ﬁve major groups of PGRs have been accidental. All this started with the observation of Charles Darwin and his son Francis Darwin when they observed that the coleoptiles of canary grass responded to unilateral illumination by growing towards the light source (phototropism). After a series of experiments, it was concluded that the tip of coleoptile was the site of transmittable inﬂuence that caused E] 13 P a b c d 247 the bending of the entire coleoptile (Figure Figure 15.10 Experiment used to demonstrate 1 5. 10).

physics/,"MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS N 45 U1 like in pigtails, for ease in manufacture, ﬂexibility and strength. A bridge has to be designed such that it can withstand the load of the ﬂowing traffic, the force of winds and its own weight. Similarly, in the design of buildings the use of beams and columns is very common. In both the cases, the overcoming of the problem of bending of beam under a load is of prime importance. The beam should not bend too much or break. Let us consider the case of a beam loaded at the centre and supported near its ends as shown in Fig. 9.8. A bar of length l, breadth b, and depth d when loaded at the centre by a load W sags by an amount given by 6= W l3/(4bd3Y) (9.17) Fig. 9.8 A beam supported at the ends and loaded at the centre. This relation can be derived using what you have already learnt and a little calculus. From Eq. (9.16). we see that to reduce the bending for a given load, one should use a material with a large Young’s modulus Y. For a given material, increasing the depth d rather than the breadth b is more effective in reducing the bending, since 6 is proportional to d ‘3 and only to b'1(of course the length lof the span should be as small as possible). But on increasing the depth, unless the load is exactly at the right place (difficult to arrange in a bridge with moving traffic). the deep bar may bend as shown in Fig. 9.9(b). This is called buckling. To avoid this, a common compromise is the cross-sectional shape shown in Fig. 9.9(c). This section provides a large load- bearing surface and enough depth to prevent bending. This shape reduces the weight of the beam without sacrificing the strength and hence reduces the cost. («—9 w (a) [b] (c) Fig. 9.9 Different cross-sectional shapes of a beam.

The answer to the question why the maximum height of a mountain on earth is ~10 km can also be provided by considering the elastic properties of rocks. A mountain base is not under uniform compression and this provides some shearing stress to the rocks under which they can ﬂow. The stress due to all the material on the top should be less than the critical shearing stress at which the rocks ﬂow.

All are marine with organ-system level of organisation. The adult echinoderms are radially symmetrical but larvae are bilaterally symmetrical. They are triploblastic and coelomate animals. Digestive system is complete with mouth on the lower (ventral) side and anus on the upper (dorsal) side. The most distinctive feature of echinoderms is the presence of water vascular system which helps in locomotion, capture and transport of food and respiration. An excretory system is absent. Sexes are separate. Reproduction is sexual. Fertilisation is usually external. Development is indirect with free-swimming larva. Examples: Asten‘as (Star ﬁsh), Echinus (Sea urchin), Antedon (Sea lily), Cucumaria (Sea cucumber) and Ophiura (Brittle star). 4.2. 10 Phylum — Hemichordata Hemichordata was earlier considered as a sub-phylum under phylum Chordata. But now it is placed as a separate phylum under non-Chordata. Hemichordates have a rudimentary structure in the collar region called stomochord, a structure similar to notochord. This phylum consists of a small group of worm-like marine animals with organ-system level of organisation. They are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic and coelomate animals. The body is cylindrical and is composed of an anterior proboscis, a collar and a long trunk (Figure 4. 15). Circulatory system is of open type. Respiration takes place through gills. Excretory organ is proboscis gland. Sexes are separate. Fertilisation is external. Development is indirect.

What happens in a system, which is a collection of such objects? A material medium provides such an example. Here, elastic forces bind the constituents to each other and, therefore, the motion of one affects that of the other. If you drop a little pebble in a pond of still water, the water surface gets disturbed. The disturbance does not remain confined to one place, but propagates outward along a circle. If you continue dropping pebbles in the pond, you see circles rapidly moving outward from the point where the water surface is disturbed. It gives a feeling as if the water is moving outward from the point of disturbance. If you put some cork pieces on the disturbed surface, it is seen that the cork pieces move up and down but do not move away from the centre of disturbance. This shows that the water mass does not ﬂow outward with the circles, but rather a moving disturbance is created. Similarly, when we speak, the sound moves outward from us, without any ﬂow of air from one part of the medium to another. The disturbances produced in air are much less obvious and only our ears or a microphone can detect them. These patterns, which move without the actual physical transfer or ﬂow of matter as a whole, are called waves. In this Chapter, we will study such waves. Waves transport energy and the pattern of disturbance has information that propagate from one point to another. All our communications essentially depend on transmission of sig- nals through waves. Speech means production of sound waves in air and hearing amounts to their detection. Often, communication involves different kinds of waves. For exam- ple, sound waves may be ﬁrst converted into an electric cur- rent signal which in turn may generate an electromagnetic wave that may be transmitted by an optical cable or via a 2019-20"

physics/,"200 PHYSICS — POINTS TO PONDER l . In considering motion of an object under the gravitational inﬂuence of another object the following quantities are conserved: (a) Angular momentum (b) Total mechanical energy Linear momentum is not conserved Angular momentum conservation leads to Kepler‘s second law. However. it is not special to the inverse square law of gravitation. It holds for any central force. In Kepler‘s third law [see Eq. [8.1] and T2 = Ks R“. The constant K5 is the same for all planets in circular orbits. This applies to satellites orbiting the Earth [[Eq. (8.38)]. An astronaut experiences weightlessness in a space satellite. This is not because the gravitational force is small at that location in space. It is because both the astronaut and the satellite are in “free fall” towards the Earth. . The gravitational potential energy associated with two particles separated by a distance r is given by Gm1m2 r The constant can be given any value. The simplest choice is to take it to be zero. With this choice V = — + constant VLM r This choice implies that V —> 0 as r —> 00. Choosing location of zero of the gravitational energy is the same as choosing the arbitrary constant in the potential energy. Note that the gravitational force is not altered by the choice of this constant. The total mechanical energy of an object is the sum of its kinetic energy [which is always positive] and the potential energy. Relative to infinity (i.e. if we presume that the potential energy of the object at inﬁnity is zero]. the gravitational potential energy of an object is negative. The total energy of a satellite is negative. The commonly encountered expression mg h for the potential energy is actually an approximation to the difference in the gravitational potential energy discussed in the point 6, above. Although the gravitational force between two particles is central. the force between two finite rigid bodies is not necessarily along the line joining their centre of mass. For a spherically symmetric body however the force on a particle external to the body is as if the mass is concentrated at the centre and this force is therefore central. . The gravitational force on a particle inside a spherical shell is zero. However. [unlike a metallic shell which shields electrical forces) the shell does not shield other bodies outside it from exerting gravitational forces on a particle inside. Gravitational shielding is not possible. EXERCISES 8.1 Answer the following : (a) You can shield a charge from electrical forces by putting it inside a hollow conductor. Can you shield a body from the gravitational inﬂuence of nearby matter by putting it inside a hollow sphere or by some other means ? (b) An astronaut inside a small space ship orbiting around the earth cannot detect gravity. If the space station orbiting around the earth has a large size, can he hope to detect gravity ? (c) If you compare the gravitational force on the earth due to the sun to that due to the moon, you would find that the Sun’s pull is greater than the moon’s pull. [you can check this yourself using the data available in the succeeding exercises). However, the tidal effect of the moon’s pull is greater than the tidal effect of sun. Why ? 2019-20"

An object that is in ﬂight after being thrown or projected is called a projectile. Such a projectile might be a football, a cricket ball, a baseball or any other object. The motion of a projectile may be thought of as the result of two separate, simultaneously occurring components of motions. One component is along a horizontal direction without any acceleration and the other along the vertical direction with constant acceleration due to the force of gravity. It was Galileo who first stated this independency of the horizontal and the vertical components of projectile motion in his Dialogue on the great world systems (1632). In our discussion, we shall assume that the air resistance has negligible effect on the motion of the projectile. Suppose that the projectile is launched with velocity v0 that makes an angle 00 with the x—aXis as shown in Fig. 4.17. After the object has been projected, the acceleration acting on it is that due to gravity which is directed vertically downward: a = -gJ' Or, ax = O, ay = — g (4.36) The components of initial velocity v0 are : 1)”: v0 cos 00 Day: vO sin 00 (4.37) O :evo cos 60%- x Fig 4. 1 7 Motion of an object prcy’ected with velocity v0 at angle 00. If we take the initial position to be the origin of the reference frame as shown in Fig. 4.17, we have : X0: 0, y0 = 0 Then, Eq.(4.34b) becomes : x= voxt= (vo cos 60) t and y = (v, Sin 0,) t—(1/2)th (4.38) The components of velocity at time t can be obtained using Eq.(4.33b) : v=v =vcos0 OX 0 0 vy = v0 sin 00 — g t (4.39) Equation (4.38) gives the x—, and y-coordinates of the position of a projectile at time tin terms of two parameters — initial speed v0 and projection angle 00. Notice that the choice of mutually perpendicular x—, and y-directions for the analysis of the projectile motion has resulted in a simplification. One of the components of velocity, i.e. x—component remains constant throughout the motion and only the y- component changes, like an object in free fall in vertical direction. This is shown graphically at few instants in Fig. 4. 18. Note that at the point of maximum height, vy= O and therefore, v 6=tan‘1—y=0 vx Equation ofpath ofa projectile What is the shape of the path followed by the projectile? This can be seen by eliminating the time between the expressions for x and y as given in Eq. (4.38). We obtain: 2019-20"

Forces Affecting the Velocity and Direction of Wind You already know that the air is set in motion due to the differences in atmospheric pressure. The air in motion is called wind. The wind blows from high pressure to low pressure. The wind at the surface experiences friction. In addition, rotation of the earth also affects the wind movement. The force exerted by the rotation of the earth is known as the Coriolis force. Thus, the horizontal winds near the earth surface respond to the combined effect of three forces — the pressure gradient force, the frictional force and the Coriolis force. In addition, the gravitational force acts downward. Pressure Gradient Force The differences in atmospheric pressure produces a force. The rate of change of pressure with respect to distance is the pressure gradient. The pressure gradient is strong where the isobars are close to each other and is weak where the isobars are apart. Frictional Force It affects the speed of the wind. It is greatest at the surface and its inﬂuence generally extends upto an elevation of l - 3 km. Over the sea surface the friction is minimal. Coriolis Force The rotation of the earth about its axis affects the direction of the wind. This force is called the Coriolis force after the French physicist who described it in 1844. It deﬂects the wind to the right direction in the northern hemisphere and 2019-2020"

Now a question that arises in our minds is: Are all living organisms made of the same chemicals, i.e., elements and compounds? You have learnt in chemistry how elemental analysis is performed. If we perform such an analysis on a plant tissue, animal tissue or a microbial paste, we obtain a list of elements like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and several others and their respective content per unit mass of a living tissue. If the same analysis is performed on a piece of earth’s crust as an example of non-living matter, we obtain a similar list. What are the differences between the two lists? In absolute terms, no such differences could be made out. All the elements present in a sample of earth’s crust are also present in a sample of living tissue. However, a closer examination reveals that the relative abundance of carbon and hydrogen with respect to other elements is higher in any living organism than in earth’s crust (Table 9.1). 9.1 How TO ANALYSE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION? We can continue asking in the same way, what type of organic compounds are found in living organisms? How does one go about finding the answer? To get an answer, one has to perform a chemical analysis. We can take any living tissue (a vegetable or a piece of liver, etc.) and grind it in trichloroacetic acid (C13CCOOH) using a mortar and a pestle. We obtain a thick slurry.

physics/,"WORK. ENERGY AND POWER 117 The work done by the force is deﬁned to be the product of component of the force in the direction of the displacement and the magnitude of this displacement. Thus W= (Fcos 0)d= Rd (6.4) We see that if there is no displacement, there is no work done even if the force is large. Thus, when you push hard against a rigid brick wall, the force you exert on the wall does no work. Yet your muscles are alternatively contracting and relaxing and internal energy is being used up and you do get tired. Thus, the meaning of work in physics is different from its usage in everyday language. No work is done if : (i) the displacement is zero as seen in the example above. A weightlifter holding a 150 kg mass steadily on his shoulder for 30 s does no work on the load during this time. (ii) the force is zero. A block moving on a smooth horizontal table is not acted upon by a horizontal force (since there is no friction), but may undergo a large displacement. (iii) the force and displacement are mutually perpendicular. This is so since, for 6 = 7c / 2 rad (= 90""), cos (TC/2) = 0. For the block moving on a smooth horizontal table, the gravitational force mg does no work since it acts at right angles to the displacement. If we assume that the moon’s orbits around the earth is perfectly circular then the earth’s gravitational force does no work. The moon’s instantaneous displacement is tangential while the earth’s force is radially inwards and 0 = 7t / 2. Work can be both positive and negative. If 0 is between 00 and 90°, cos 0 in Eq. (6.4) is positive. If 0 is between 900 and 1800, cos 0 is negative. In many examples the frictional force opposes displacement and 0 = 180”. Then the work done by friction is negative (cos 1800 = —1). From Eq. (6.4) it is clear that work and energy have the same dimensions, [ML2T2]. The SI unit of these is joule (J), named after the famous British physicist James Prescott Joule (1 8 1 1- 1 869). Since work and energy are so widely used as physical concepts, alternative units abound and some of these are listed in Table 6. 1.

During this process. the force on the cycle due to the road is 200 N and is directly opposed to the motion. (a) How much work does the road do on the cycle ‘? (b) How much work does the cycle do on the road ? Answer Work done on the cycle by the road is the work done by the stopping (frictional) force on the cycle due to the road. (a) The stopping force and the displacement make an angle of 180° (7: rad) with each other. Thus, work done by the road, Wr= chosO = 200x 10><cos7c = — 2000 J It is this negative work that brings the cycle to a halt in accordance with WE theorem. (b) From Newton’s Third Law an equal and opposite force acts on the road due to the cycle. Its magnitude is 200 N. However, the road undergoes no displacement. Thus, work done by cycle on the road is zero. 4 The lesson of Example 6.3 is that though the force on a body A exerted by the body B is always equal and opposite to that on B by A (Newton’s Third Law); the work done on A by B is not necessarily equal and opposite to the work done on B by A. 6.4 KINETIC ENERGY As noted earlier, if an object of mass m has velocity v, its kinetic energy K is 1 1 2 K = —mv.v = —mv _ 2 2 (6 5) Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity.

While treating the topic of projectile motion. we have stated that we assume that the air resistance has no effect on the motion of the projectile. You must understand what the statement really means. Friction, force due to viscosity, air resistance are all dissipative forces. In the presence of any of such forces opposing motion, any object will lose some part of its initial energy and consequently, momentum too. Thus, a projectile that traverses a parabolic path would certainly show deviation from its idealised trajectory in the presence of air resistance. It will not hit the ground with the same speed with which it was projected from it. In the absence of air resistance, the x-component of the velocity remains constant and it is only the y-component that undergoes a continuous change. However. in the presence of air resistance, both of these would get affected. That would mean that the range would be less than the one given by Eq. (4.43). Maximum height attained would also be less than that predicted by Eq. (4.42). Can you then, anticipate the change in the time of ﬂight? In order to avoid air resistance. we will have to perform the experiment in vacuum or under low pressure, which is not easy. When we use a phrase like ‘neglect air resistance’. we imply that the change in parameters such as range. height etc. is much smaller than their values without air resistance. The calculation without air resistance is much simpler than that with air resistance. 4. 1 1 UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION When an object follows a circular path at a constant speed, the motion of the object is called uniform circular motion. The word “uniform” refers to the speed, which is uniform (constant) throughout the motion. Suppose an object is moving with uniform speed 1) in a circle of radius R as shown in Fig. 4. 19. Since the velocity of the object is changing continuously in direction, the object undergoes acceleration. Let us find the magnitude and the direction of this acceleration. 2019-20"

The total of debit column of trial balance should agree with the total of credit column in the trial balance because the accounts are based on double entry system. However, this method is not widely used in practice, as it does not help in assuming accuracy of balances of various accounts and and preparation of the fianancial statements. 6.3.2 Balances Method This is the most widely used method in practice. Under this method trial balance is prepared by showing the balances of all ledger accounts and then totalling up the debit and credit columns of the trial balance to assure their correctness. The account balances are used because the balance summarises the net effect of all transactions relating to an account and helps in preparing the financial statements. It may be noted that in trial balance, normally in place of balances in individual accounts of the debtors, a figure of sundry debtors is shown, and in place of individual accounts of creditors, a figure of sundry creditors is shown. 6.3.3 Totals-cum—balances Method This method is a combination of totals method and balances method.

Then, by definition v — vo v — v0 t— o 2 t Or, v 2 v0 + at (4.3321) In terms of components : vx = on + axt W + ayt (4.33b) Let us now find how the position r changes with time. We follow the method used in the one- dimensional case. Let rn and r be the position vectors of the particle at time 0 and tand let the velocities at these instants be v0 and v. Then, over this time interval t, the average velocity is (vn + v) / 2. The displacement is the average velocity multiplied by the time interval : r_ro=(v+vo)t=[(vo+at)+vo]t a: vy=v 2 2 2019-20"

physics/,"OSCILLATIONS 351 It follows from Eqs. (14.15) and (14.17) that the total energy, E, of the system is, E =U+K = % kA2 cos2(wt + ¢) + % kA2 sin2(a)t + ¢) = g k A2 [cos2(a)t + ¢) + sin2(a)t + m] Using the familiar trigonometric identity, the value of the expression in the brackets is unity. Thus, = l k A2 (14.18) 2 The total mechanical energy of a harmonic oscillator is thus independent of time as expected for motion under any conservative force.

The kinetic energy and potential energy both repeat after a period T/ 2. The total energy remains constant at all t or x. Observe that both kinetic energy and potential energy in SHM are seen to be always positive in Fig. 14.16. Kinetic energy can, of course, be never negative, since it is proportional to the square of speed. Potential energy is positive by choice of the undermined constant in potential energy. Both kinetic energy and potential energy peak twice during each period of SHM. For x = 0, the energy is kinetic; at the extremes x = iA, it is all potential energy. In the course of motion between these limits, kinetic energy increases at the expense of potential energy or vice-versa. Example 14.7 Ablock whose mass is 1 kg is fastened to a spring. The spring has a spring constant of 50 N m‘l. The block is pulled to a distance x = 10 cm from its equilibrium position at x = 0 on a frictionless surface from rest at t = 0.

biology/,"STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS into a central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), a peripheral nervous system (cranial and spinal nerves) and an autonomic nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic). There are ten pairs of cranial nerves arising from the brain. Brain is enclosed in a bony structure called brain box (cranium). The brain is divided into fore-brain, mid-brain and hind-brain. Forebrain includes olfactory lobes, paired cerebral hemispheres and unpaired diencephalon. The midbrain is characterised by a pair of optic lobes. Hind-brain consists of cerebellum and medulla oblongata. The medulla oblongata passes out through the foramen magnum and continues into spinal cord, which is enclosed in the vertebral column. Frog has different types of sense organs, namely organs of touch (sensory papillae), taste (taste buds), smell (nasal epithelium), vision (eyes) and hearing (tympanum with internal ears). Out of these, eyes and internal ears are well-organised structures and the rest are cellular aggregations around nerve endings. Eyes in a frog are a pair of spherical structures situated in the orbit in skull. These are simple eyes (possessing only one unit). External ear is absent in frogs and only tympanum can be seen externally. The ear is an organ of hearing as well as balancing (equilibrium). Frogs have well organised male and female reproductive systems. Male reproductive organs consist of a pair of yellowish ovoid testes (Figure 7.2 1), which are found adhered to the upper part of kidneys by a double fold of peritoneum called mesorchium. Vasa efferentia are 1 0- 1 2 in number that arise from testes. They enter the kidneys on their side and open into Bidder’s canal. Finally it communicates with the urinogenital duct that comes out of the kidneys and opens into the cloaca. The cloaca is a small, median chamber that is used to pass faecal matter, urine and sperms to the exterior. The female reproductive organs include a pair of ovaries (Figure 7.22). The ovaries are situated near kidneys and there is no functional connection with kidneys.

biology/,"PLANT KINGDOM Bryophytes are also called amphibians of the plant kingdom because these plants can live in soil but are dependent on water for sexual reproduction. They usually occur in damp, humid and shaded localities. They play an important role in plant succession on bare rocks / soil. The plant body of bryophytes is more differentiated than that of algae. It is thallus-like and prostrate or erect, and attached to the substratum by unicellular or multicellular rhizoids. They lack true roots, stem or leaves. They may possess root-like, leaf-like or stem-like structures. The main plant body of the bryophyte is haploid. It produces gametes, hence is called a gametophyte. The sex organs in bryophytes are multicellular. The male sex organ is called antheridium. They produce biﬂagellate antherozoids. The female sex organ called archegonium is ﬂask-shaped and produces a single egg. The antherozoids are released into water where they come in contact with archegonium. An antherozoid fuses with the egg to produce the zygote. Zygotes do not undergo reduction division immediately. They produce a multicellular body called a sporophyte. The sporophyte is not free-living but attached to the photosynthetic gametophyte and derives nourishment from it. Some cells of the sporophyte undergo reduction division (meiosis) to produce haploid spores. These spores germinate to produce gametophyte. Bryophytes in general are of little economic importance but some mosses provide food for herbaceous mammals, birds and other animals. Species of Sphagnum a moss, provide peat that have long been used as fuel, and as packing material for trans-shipment of living material because of their capacity to hold water. Mosses along with lichens are the ﬁrst organisms to colonise rocks and hence, are of great ecological importance. They decompose rocks making the substrate suitable for the growth of higher plants. Since mosses form dense mats on the soil, they reduce the impact of falling rain and prevent soil erosion. The bryophytes are divided into liverworts and mosses. 3.2. 1 Liverworts The liverworts grow usually in moist, shady habitats such as banks of streams, marshy ground, damp soil, bark of trees and deep in the woods. The plant body of a liverwort is thalloid, e. g., Marchantia. The thallus is dorsiventral and closely appressed to the substrate. The leafy members have tiny leaf-like appendages in two rows on the stem-like structures. Asexual reproduction in liverworts takes place by fragmentation of thalli, or by the formation of specialised structures called gemmae (sing. gemma). Gemmae are green, multicellular, asexual buds, which develop in small receptacles called gemma cups located on the thalli. The gemmae become detached from the parent body and germinate to form new individuals. During sexual reproduction, male and female sex 35"

In practice we come across systems that execute simple harmonic motion approximately under certain conditions. In the subsequent part of this section, we discuss the motion executed by some such systems. 14.8.1 Oscillations due to a Spring The simplest observable example of simple harmonic motion is the small oscillations of a block of mass m fixed to a spring, which in turn is fixed to a rigid wall as shown in Fig. 14.17. The block is placed on a frictionless horizontal surface. If the block is pulled on one side and is released, it then executes a to and fro motion about the mean position. Let x = 0, indicate the position of the centre of the block when the 2019-20 Fig. 1 4.1 7 A linear simple harmonic oscillator consisting of a block of mass m attached to a spring. The block moves over a frictionless surface. The box, when pulled or pushed and released, executes simple harmonic motion. spring is in equilibrium. The positions marked as —A and +A indicate the maximum displacements to the left and the right of the mean position. We have already learnt that springs have special properties, which were first discovered by the English physicist Robert Hooke. He had shown that such a system when deformed, is subject to a restoring force, the magnitude of which is proportional to the deformation or the displacement and acts in opposite direction. This is known as Hooke’s law (Chapter 9). It holds good for displacements small in comparison to the length of the spring. At any time t, if the displacement of the block from its mean position is x, the restoring force F acting on the block is, F(x) =—kx (14.19) The constant of proportionality, k, is called the spring constant, its value is governed by the elastic properties of the spring. A stiff spring has large k and a soft spring has small k. Equation (14.19) is same as the force law for SHM and therefore the system executes a simple harmonic motion. From Eq. (14.14) we have, a): E (14.20) m and the period, T, of the oscillator is given by, Tad? (14.21) Stiff springs have high value of k (spring constant). A block of small mass m attached to a stiff spring will have, according to Eq. (14.20), large oscillation frequency, as expected physically."

Arrival of the disturbance at the neuron’s endings, or output zone, triggers events that may cause stimulation or inhibition of adjacent neurons and other cells (You will study the details in Chapter 2 1). 7.2 ORGAN AND ORGAN SYSTEM The basic tissues mentioned above organise to form organs which in turn associate to form organ systems in the multicellular organisms. Such an organisation is essential for more efficient and better coordinated activities of millions of cells constituting an organism. Each organ in our body is made of one or more type of tissues. For example, our heart consists of all the four types of tissues, i.e., epithelial, connective, muscular and neural. We also notice, after some careful study that the complexity in organ and organ systems displays certain discernable trend. This discernable trend is called evolutionary trend (You will study the details in class XII). You are being introduced to morphology and anatomy of three organisms at different evolutionary levels to show their organisation and functioning. Morphology refers to study of form or externally visible features. In the case of plants or microbes, the term morphology precisely means only this. In case of animals this refers to the external appearance of the organs or parts of the body. The word anatomy conventionally is used for the study of morphology of internal organs in the animals. You will learn the morphology and anatomy of earthworm, cockroach and frog representing invertebrates and vertebrates. 7.3 EARTHWORM Earthworm is a reddish brown terrestrial invertebrate that inhabits the upper layer of the moist soil. During day time, they live in burrows made by boring and swallowing the soil. In the gardens, they can be traced by their faecal deposits known as worm castings. The common Indian earthworms are Pheretima and Lumbricus. 7 .3. 1 Morphology Earthworms have long cylindrical body. The body is divided into more than hundred short segments which are similar (metameres about 100- 120 in number). The dorsal surface of the body is marked by a dark median mid dorsal line (dorsal blood vessel) along the longitudinal axis of the body. The ventral surface is distinguished by the presence of genital openings (pores). Anterior end consists of the mouth and the prostomium, a lobe which serves as a covering for the mouth and as a wedge to force open cracks in the soil into which the earthworm may crawl. ’Ihe prostomium is sensory in function. The ﬁrst body segment is called the peristomium (buccal segment) which contains the mouth. In a mature worm, segments"
biology/,"CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION 10.1. 1 Phases of Cell Cycle A typical eukaryotic cell cycle is illustrated by human cells in culture. These cells divide once in approximately every 24 hours (Figure 10.1). However, this duration of cell cycle can vary from organism to organism and also from cell type to cell type. Yeast for example, can progress through the cell cycle in only about 90 minutes. The cell cycle is divided into two basic phases: 0 Interphase o M Phase (Mitosis phase) The M Phase represents the phase when the actual cell division or mitosis occurs and the interphase represents the phase between two successive M phases. It is significant to note that in the 24 hour average duration of cell cycle of a human cell, cell division proper lasts for only about an hour. The interphase lasts more than 95% of the duration of cell cycle. 163 M Phase Metapham‘. Figure 10.1 A diagrammatic view of cell cycle indicating formation of two cells from one cell The M Phase starts with the nuclear division, corresponding to the separation of daughter chromosomes (karyokinesis) and usually ends with division of cytoplasm (cytokinesis). The interphase, though called the resting phase, is the time during which the cell is preparing for division by undergoing both cell growth and DNA replication in an orderly manner. The interphase is divided into three further phases: 0 G1 phase (Gap 1) o S phase (Synthesis) 0 G2 phase (Gap 2) G1 phase corresponds to the interval between mitosis and initiation of DNA replication. During G1 phase the cell is metabolically active and continuously grows but does not replicate its DNA. S or synthesis phase marks the period during which DNA synthesis or replication takes place. During this time the amount of DNA per cell doubles. If the initial amount of DNA is denoted as 2C then it increases to 4C. However, there is no increase in the chromosome number; if the cell had diploid or 2n number of chromosomes at G1, even after S phase the number of chromosomes remains the same, i.e., 2n. In animal cells, during the S phase, DNA replication begins in the nucleus, and the centriole duplicates in the cytoplasm. During the G2 phase, proteins are synthesised in preparation for mitosis while cell growth continues. How do plants and animals continue to grow all their lives? Do all cells in a plant divide all the time? Do you think all cells continue to divide in all plants and animals? Can you tell the name and the location of tissues having cells that divide all their life in higher plants? Do animals have similar meristematic tissues? 2019-2020"
geography/,"124 A habitat in the ecological sense is the totality of the physical and chemical factors that constitute the general environment. A system consisting of biotic and abiotic components is known as ecosystem. All these components in ecosystem are inter related and interact with each other. Different types of ecosystems exist with varying ranges of environmental conditions where various plants and animal species have got adapted through evolution. This phenomenon is known as ecological adaptation. Types of Ecosystems Ecosystems are of two major types: terrestrial and aquatic. Terrestrial ecosystem can be further be classiﬁed into ‘biomes’. A biome is a plant and animal community that covers a large geographical area. The boundaries of different biomes on land are determined mainly by climate. Therefore, a biome can be defined as the total assemblage of plant and animal species interacting within specific conditions. These include rainfall, temperature, humidity and soil conditions. Some of the major biomes of the world are: forest, grassland, desert and tundra biomes. Aquatic ecosystems can be classed as marine and freshwater ecosystems. Marine ecosystem includes the oceans, estuaries and coral reefs. Freshwater FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY ecosystem includes lakes, ponds, streams, marshes and bogs. Structure and Functions of Ecosystems The structure of an ecosystem involves a description of the available plant and animal species. From a structural point of view, all ecosystems consist of abiotic and biotic factors. Abiotic factors include rainfall, temperature, sunlight, atmospheric humidity, soil conditions, inorganic substances (carbon dioxide, water, nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, etc.). Biotic factors include the producers, the consumers (primary, secondary, tertiary) and the decomposers. The producers include all the green plants, which manufacture their own food through photosynthesis. The primary consumers include herbivorous animals like deer, goats, mice and all plant-eating animals. The carnivores include all the ﬂesh-eating animals like snakes, tigers and lions. Certain carnivores that feed also on carnivores are known as top carnivores like hawks and mongooses. Decomposers are those that feed on dead organisms (for example, scavengers like vultures and crows), and further breaking down of the dead matter by other decomposing agents like bacteria and various micro- organisms.

physics/,"Maxwell Distribution Function In a given mass of gas. the velocities of all molecules are not the same. even when bulk parameters like pressure. volume and temperature are fixed. Collisions change the direction and the speed of molecules. However in a state of equilibrium. the distribution of speeds is constant. or fixed. Distributions are very important and useful when dealing with systems containing large number of objects. As an example consider the ages of different persons in a city. It is not feasible to deal with the age of each individual. We can divide the people into groups: children up to age 20 years. adults between ages of 20 and 60. old people above 60. If we want more detailed information we can choose smaller intervals, 0- 1, 1-2 ..... 99—100 of age groups. When the size of the interval becomes smaller, say half year, the number of persons in the interval will also reduce. roughly half the original number in the one year interval. The number of persons dN(x] in the age interval xand x+dx is proportional to dx or dN(x) = nv dx. We have used nx to denote the number of persons at the value of x.

physics/,"LAWS OF MOTION The total momentum of an isolated system of interacting particles is conserved. An important example of the application of the law of conservation of momentum is the collision of two bodies. Consider two bodies A and B, with initial momenta p A and p3. The bodies collide, get apart, with final momenta p’A and p’B respectively. By the Second Law FABAt 2 PA — PA and FBAAt = P’B — PB (where we have taken a common interval of time for both forces i.e. the time for which the two bodies are in contact.) Since F AB = —FBA by the third law, p’A — pA = -(pia — p3) Le. P’A + P’B 2 PA + PB (5'9) which shows that the total final momentum of the isolated system equals its initial momentum. Notice that this is true whether the collision is elastic or inelastic. In elastic collisions, there is a second condition that the total initial kinetic energy of the system equals the total final kinetic energy (See Chapter 6). 5.8 EQUILIBRIUM OF A PARTICLE Equilibrium of a particle in mechanics refers to the situation when the net external force on the particle is zero’."" According to the first law, this means that, the particle is either at rest or in uniform motion. If two forces F1 and F2, act on a particle, equilibrium requires F1 = _F2 (5.10) i.e. the two forces on the particle must be equal and opposite. Equilibrium under three concurrent forces F1, F2 and F3 requires that the vector sum of the three forces is zero. F1+F2 +F3 = o (5.11) * Equilibrium of a body requires not only translational equilibrium (zero net external force) but also rotational 99 Fig. 5. 7 Equilibrium under concurrent forces. In other words, the resultant of any two forces say F1 and F2, obtained by the parallelogram law of forces must be equal and opposite to the third force, F3. As seen in Fig. 5.7, the three forces in equilibrium can be represented by the sides of a triangle with the vector arrows taken in the same sense. The result can be generalised to any number of forces. A particle is in equilibrium under the action of forces F1, F2, Fn if they can be represented by the sides of a closed n-sided polygon with arrows directed in the same sense. Equation (5.1 1) implies that F1x + F2x+ F3x = 0 Fly + FZy + Fsy = 0 F12 +FZZ+F3Z=O (5.12) where FIX, Fly and F12 are the components of F1 along x, y and 2 directions respectively. > Example 5.6 See Fig. 5.8.

Majority of these studies employed either surviving tissue model or straightaway cell- free systems. An explosion of knowledge resulted in molecular biology. Molecular physiology became almost synonymous with biochemistry and biophysics. However, it is now being increasingly realised that neither a purely organismic approach nor a purely reductionistic molecular approach would reveal the truth about biological processes or living phenomena. Systems biology makes us believe that all living phenomena are emergent properties due to interaction among components of the system under study. Regulatory network of molecules, supra molecular assemblies, cells, tissues, organisms and indeed, populations and communities, each create emergent properties.

physics/,"356 PHYSICS The damping force depends on the nature of the surrounding medium. If the block is immersed in a liquid, the magnitude of damping will be much greater and the dissipation of energy much faster. The damping force is generally proportional to velocity of the bob. [Remember Stokes’ Law, Eq. (10.19)] and acts opposite to the direction of velocity. If the damping force is denoted by F d, we have Fd =—bv (1430) where the positive constant b depends on characteristics of the medium (viscosity, for example) and the size and shape of the block, etc. Eq. (14.30) is usually valid only for small velocity. When the mass m is attached to the spring (hung vertically as shown in Fig. 14.19) and released, the spring will elongate a little and the mass will settle at some height. This position, shown by O in Fig 14.19, is the equilibrium position of the mass. If the mass is pulled down or pushed up a little, the restoring force on the block due to the spring is FS = —kx, where x is the displacement* of the mass from its equilibrium position. Thus, the total force acting on the mass at any time t, is F = 40: —bv. If a(t) is the acceleration of mass at time t, then by Newton’s Law of Motion applied along the direction of motion, we have m a(t) = —k x(t) — b v(t) (14.31) Here we have dropped the vector notation because we are discussing one-dimensional motion. Using the first and second derivatives of x (t) for v (t) and a (t), respectively, we have 2 d): +bd—x+kx=0 (14-32) dt (:11: The solution of Eq. (14.32) describes the motion of the block under the inﬂuence of a damping force which is proportional to velocity. The solution is found to be of the form x(t) = A e‘bt/Zm cos (out + ¢) (14.33) m where A is the amplitude and (0' is the angular frequency of the damped oscillator given by, 2 60': E_ b (14.34) m 4m2 In this function, the cosine function has a period 27r/a)’ but the function x(t) is not strictly periodic because of the factor 64’ ”2’” which decreases continuously with time. However, if the decrease is small in one time period T, the motion represented by Eq. (14.33) is approximately periodic. The solution, Eq. (14.33), can be graphically represented as shown in Fig. 14.20. We can regard it as a cosine function whose amplitude, which is Aéb ”2m, gradually decreases with time. 10 ‘10“ 5 10 15 2o 25 t Fig. 14.20 A damped oscillator is approximately periodic with decreasing amplitude of oscillation. With greater damping, oscillations die out faster. Now the mechanical energy of the undamped oscillator is 1/ 2 kA2. For a damped oscillator, the amplitude is not constant but depends on time. For small damping, we may use the same expression but regard the amplitude as A ebt/Zm E(t) =% k A2 6%... (14.35) Equation (14.35) shows that the total energy of the system decreases exponentially with time. Note that small damping means that the b km dimensionless ratio [ jis much less than 1. * Under gravity, the block will be at a certain equilibrium position 0 on the spring; x here represents the disp lacement from that position. 2019-20"
physics/,"24 PHYSICS to sign and size. These can arise due to random and unpredictable ﬂuctuations in experimental conditions (e.g. unpredictable ﬂuctuations in temperature, voltage supply, mechanical vibrations of experimental set-ups, etc), personal (unbiased) errors by the observer taking readings, etc. For example, when the same person repeats the same observation, it is very likely that he may get different readings everytime. Least count error The smallest value that can be measured by the measuring instrument is called its least count. All the readings or measured values are good only up to this value. The least count error is the error associated with the resolution of the instrument. For example, a vernier callipers has the least count as 0.01 cm; a spherometer may have a least count of 0.001 cm. Least count error belongs to the category of random errors but within a limited size; it occurs with both systematic and random errors. If we use a metre scale for measurement of length, it may have graduations at 1 mm division scale spacing or interval. Using instruments of higher precision, improving experimental techniques, etc., we can reduce the least count error. Repeating the observations several times and taking the arithmetic mean of all the observations, the mean value would be very close to the true value of the measured quantity. 2.6.1 Absolute Error. Relative Error and Percentage Error (a) Suppose the values obtained in several measurements are al, a2, a3...., an. The arithmetic mean of these values is taken as the best possible value of the quantity under the given conditions of measurement as : mean = (a1+a2+a3+""'+an) / n (2.4) or, n am"" 2 21:6” / ” (2.5) i: This is because, as explained earlier, it is reasonable to suppose that individual measurements are as likely to overestimate 2019-20 as to underestimate the true value of the quantity. The magnitude of the difference between the individual measurement and the true value of the quantity is called the absolute error of the measurement. This is denoted by |Aa |. In absence of any other method of knowing true value, we considered arithmatic mean as the true value. Then the errors in the individual measurement values from the true value, are = a1 — a Aal , mean A612 = a2 — am an’ Aa n = an. — amean The Aa calculated above may be positive in certain cases and negative in some other cases. But absolute error IAaI will always be positive. (b) The arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors is taken as the ﬁnal or mean absolute error of the value of the physical quantity a. It is represented by Aamm. Thus, Aamm= (IAa1|+IAa2 I+|Aa3|+,__+ 'Aanll/n (2.6) = Z IAail /n (2.7) i=1 If we do a single measurement, the value we get may be in the range amem i Aa mean i.e. a=a iAa mean mean or, —ACl <Cl<Cl +ACl mean mean _ _ mean mean (2.8) This implies that any measurement of the physical quantity a is likely to lie between (a + Aamem) and (am — Aa ). mean an mean (c) Instead of the absolute error, we often use the relative error or the percentage error (8a).

physics/,"MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 257 moves inside the master cylinder, and the pressure caused is transmitted through the brake oil to act on a piston of larger area. A large force acts on the piston and is pushed down expanding the brake shoes against brake lining. In this way, a small force on the pedal produces a large retarding force on the wheel. An important advantage of the system is that the pressure set up by pressing pedal is transmitted equally to all cylinders attached to the four wheels so that the braking effort is equal on all wheels. 10.3 STREAMLINE FLOW So far we have studied ﬂuids at rest. The study of the ﬂuids in motion is known as ﬂuid dynamics. When a water tap is turned on slowly, the water ﬂow is smooth initially, but loses its smoothness when the speed of the outﬂow is increased. In studying the motion of ﬂuids, we focus our attention on what is happening to various ﬂuid particles at a particular point in space at a particular time. The ﬂow of the ﬂuid is said to be steady if at any given point, the velocity of each passing ﬂuid particle remains constant in time. This does not mean that the velocity at different points in space is same. The velocity of a particular particle may change as it moves from one point to another. That is, at some other point the particle may have a different velocity, but every other particle which passes the second point behaves exactly as the previous particle that has just passed that point. Each particle follows a smooth path, and the paths of the particles do not cross each other. Fig. 10.7 The meaning of streamlines. (a) A typical trajectory of a ﬂuid particle. (b) A region of streamline ﬂow. The path taken by a ﬂuid particle under a steady ﬂow is a streamline. It is defined as a curve whose tangent at any point is in the direction of the ﬂuid velocity at that point. Consider the path of a particle as shown in Fig.10.7 (a), the curve describes how a ﬂuid particle moves with time. The curve PQ is like a permanent map of ﬂuid ﬂow, indicating how the ﬂuid streams. No two streamlines can cross, for if they do, an oncoming ﬂuid particle can go either one way or the other and the ﬂow would not be steady. Hence, in steady ﬂow, the map of ﬂow is stationary in time. How do we draw closely spaced streamlines ? If we intend to show streamline of every ﬂowing particle, we would end up with a continuum of lines. Consider planes perpendicular to the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow e. g., at three points P, R and Q in Fig. 10.7 (b). The plane pieces are so chosen that their boundaries be determined by the same set of streamlines. This means that number of ﬂuid particles crossing the surfaces as indicated at P, R and Q is the same. If area of cross- sections at these points are AP ,AR and AQ and speeds of ﬂuid particles are PP,v DR and v9, then mass of ﬂuid AmP crossing at AP Rin a small interval of time At is pPAPvP At. Similarly mass of ﬂuid AmR ﬂowing or crossing at AR in a small interval of time At is pPPARv At and mass of ﬂuid AmQ is pQAQvQ At crossing at A9. The mass of liquid ﬂowing out equals the mass ﬂowing in, holds in all cases. Therefore, pPAPvPAt— — pRARvR At— — pQAQvQAt (10.9) For ﬂow of incompressible ﬂuids Pp: PR: Pg Equation (10. 9) reduces to APvP =APvR = AgvQ (10.10) which is called the equation of continuity and it is a statement of conservation of mass in ﬂow of incompressible ﬂuids. In general Av = constant (10.1 1) Av gives the volume ﬂux or ﬂow rate and remains constant throughout the pipe of ﬂow. Thus, at narrower portions where the streamlines are closely spaced. velocity increases and its vice versa. From (Fig 10.7b) it is clear that AR > A9 or UR < v9, the ﬂuid is accelerated while passing from R to Q This is associated with a change in pressure in ﬂuid ﬂow in horizontal pipes. Steady ﬂow is achieved at low ﬂow speeds. Beyond a limiting value, called critical speed, this ﬂow loses steadiness and becomes turbulent. One sees this when a fast ﬂowing 2019-20"
biology/,"PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS These graphs, together, show that most of the photosynthesis takes place in the blue and red regions of the spectrum; some photosynthesis does take place at the other wavelengths of the visible spectrum. Let us see how this happens. Though chlorophyll is the major pigment responsible for trapping light, other thylakoid pigments like chlorophyll b, xanthophylls and carotenoids, which are called accessory pigments, also absorb light and transfer the energy to chlorophyll a. Indeed, they not only enable a wider range of wavelength of incoming light to be utilised for photosyntesis but also protect chlorophyll a from photo-oxidation. 13.5 WHAT Is LIGHT REACTION? Light reactions or the ‘Photochemical’ phase include light absorption, water splitting, oxygen release, and the formation of high-energy chemical intermediates, ATP and NADPH. Several protein complexes are involved in the process. The pigments are organised into two discrete photochemical light harvesting complexes (LHC) within the Photosystem I (PS I) and Photosystem II (PS II). These are named in the sequence of their discovery, and not in the sequence in which they function during the light reaction. The LHC are made up of Photon hundreds of pigment molecules bound to . , proteins. Each photosystem has all the pigments . . . (except one molecule of chlorophyll a) forming . a light harvesting system also called antennae (Figure 13.4). These pigments help to make photosynthesis more efﬁcient by absorbing different wavelengths of light. The single chlorophyll a molecule forms the reaction centre. The reaction centre is different in both the photosystems. In PS I the reaction centre chlorophyll a has an absorption peak at 700 nm, hence is called P700, while in PS II it has absorption maxima at 680 nm, and is called P680. 13.6 THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT In photosystem II the reaction centre chlorophyll a absorbs 680 nm wavelength of red light causing electrons to become excited and jump into an orbit farther from the atomic nucleus. These electrons are picked up by an electron acceptor which passes them to an electrons transport Reaction centre Figure 13.4 The light harvesting complex"

Do you remember studying cross sections of roots, stems and leaves of higher plants and studying the vascular system? The higher plants have highly specialised vascular tissues — xylem and phloem. Xylem is associated with translocation of mainly water, mineral salts, some organic nitrogen and hormones, from roots to the aerial parts of the plants. The phloem translocates a variety of organic and inorganic solutes, mainly from the leaves to other parts of the plants. 1 1.3. 1 How do Plants Absorb Water? We know that the roots absorb most of the water that goes into plants; obviously that is why we apply water to the soil and not on the leaves. The responsibility of absorption of water and minerals is more speciﬁcally the function of the root hairs that are present in millions at the tips of the roots. Root hairs are thin-walled slender extensions of root epidermal cells that greatly increase the surface area for absorption. Water is absorbed along with mineral solutes, by the root hairs, purely by diffusion. Once water is absorbed by the root hairs, it can move deeper into root layers by two distinct pathways: ' apoplast pathway ' symplast pathway The apoplast is the system of adjacent cell walls that is continuous throughout the plant, except at the casparian strips of the endodermis in the roots (Figure 1 1.6).

Kidney and Gastrointestinal Tract Mechanism of Honnone Action HOSOCHZZ CHAPTER 22 CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION You have already learnt that the neural system provides a point-to-point rapid coordination among organs. The neural coordination is fast but short-lived. As the nerve fibres do not innervate all cells of the body and the cellular functions need to be continuously regulated; a special kind of coordination and integration has to be provided. This function is carried out by hormones. The neural system and the endocrine system jointly coordinate and regulate the physiological functions in the body. 22.1 ENDOCRINE GLANDs AND HORMONES Endocrine glands lack ducts and are hence, called ductless glands. Their secretions are called hormones. The classical definition of hormone as a chemical produced by endocrine glands and released into the blood and transported to a distantly located target organ has current scientific deﬁnition as follows: Hormones are non-nutrient chemicals which act as intercellular messengers and are produced in trace amounts. The new definition covers a number of new molecules in addition to the hormones secreted by the organised endocrine glands. Invertebrates possess very simple endocrine systems with few hormones whereas a large number of chemicals act as hormones and provide coordination in the vertebrates. The human endocrine system is described here. 2019-2020"
biology/,"32 BIOLOGY Algae are useful to man in a variety of ways. At least a half of the total carbon dioxide fixation on earth is carried out by algae through photosynthesis. Being photosynthetic they increase the level of dissolved oxygen in their immediate environment. They are of paramount importance as primary producers of energy-rich compounds which form the basis of the food cycles of all aquatic animals. Many species of Porphyra, Laminaria and Sargassum are among the 7 0 species of marine algae used as food. Certain marine brown and red algae produce large amounts of hydrocolloids (water holding substances), e. g., algin (brown algae) and carrageen (red algae) which are used commercially. Agar, one of the commercial products obtained from Gelidium and Gracilaria are used to grow microbes and in preparations of ice-creams and jellies. Chlorella a unicellular alga rich in proteins is used as food supplement even by space travellers. The algae are divided into three main classes: Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae. 3. 1 . 1 Chlorophyceae The members of chlorophyceae are commonly called green algae. The plant body may be unicellular, colonial or ﬁlamentous. They are usually grass green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and b. The pigments are localised in deﬁnite chloroplasts. The chloroplasts may be discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon-shaped in different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called pyrenoids located in the chloroplasts. Pyrenoids contain protein besides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets. Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made of an inner layer of cellulose and an outer layer of pectose. Vegetative reproduction usually takes place by fragmentation or by formation of different types of spores. Asexual reproduction is by ﬂagellated zoospores produced in zoosporangia. The sexual reproduction shows considerable variation in the type and formation of sex cells and it may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous. Some commonly found green algae are: Chlamydomonas, Volvox, Ulothrix, Spirogyra and Chara (Figure 3.1a). 3. 1 .2 Phaeophyceae The members of phaeophyceae or brown algae are found primarily in marine habitats. They show great variation in size and form. They range from simple branched, ﬁlamentous forms (Ectocarpus) to profusely branched forms as represented by kelps, which may reach a height of 100 metres. They possess chlorophyll a, c, carotenoids and xanthophylls.

In monocotyledons, the leaf base expands into a sheath covering the stem partially or wholly. In some leguminous plants the leafbase may become swollen, which is called the pulvinus. The petiole help hold the blade to light. Long thin ﬂexible petioles allow leaf blades to ﬂutter in wind, thereby cooling the leaf and bringing fresh air to leaf surface. The lamina or the leaf blade is the green expanded part of the leaf with veins and veinlets. There is, usually, a middle prominent vein, which is known as the midrib. Veins provide rigidity to the leaf blade and act as channels of transport for water, minerals and food materials. The shape, margin, apex, surface and extent of incision of lamina varies in different leaves. 5.3. 1 Venation The arrangement of veins and the veinlets in the lamina of leaf is termed as venation. When the veinlets form a network, the venation is termed as reticulate (Figure 5.7 b). When the veins run parallel to each other within a lamina, the venation is termed as parallel (Figure 5.7 0). Leaves of dicotyledonous plants generally possess reticulate venation, while parallel venation is the characteristic of most monocotyledons. 5.3.2 Types of Leaves A leaf is said to be simple, when its lamina is entire or when incised, the incisions do not touch the midrib. When the incisions of the lamina reach up to the midrib breaking it into a number of leaﬂets, the leaf is called compound. A bud is present in the am’l of petiole in both simple and compound leaves, but not in the am’l of leaﬂets of the compound leaf. The compound leaves may be of two types (Figure 5.8). In a pinnately compound leaf a number of leaﬂets are present on a common axis, the rachis, which represents the midrib of the leaf as in neem."
biology/,"208 BIOLOGY It was not until about 1854 that Julius von Sachs provided evidence for production of glucose when plants grow. Glucose is usually stored as starch. His later studies showed that the green substance in plants (chlorophyll as we know it now) is located in special bodies (later called chloroplasts) within plant cells. He found that the green parts in plants is where glucose is made, and that the glucose is usually stored as starch. Now consider the interesting experiments done by T.W Engelmann (1843 — 1909). Using a prism he split light into its spectral components and then illuminated a green alga, Cladophora, placed in a suspension of aerobic bacteria. The bacteria were used to detect the sites of 02 evolution. He observed that the bacteria accumulated mainly in the region of blue and red light of the split spectrum. A first action spectrum of photosynthesis was thus described. It resembles roughly the absorption spectra of chlorophyll aand b (discussed in section 13.4). By the middle of the nineteenth century the key features of plant photosynthesis were known, namely, that plants could use light energy to make carbohydrates from CO2 and water. The empirical equation representing the total process of photosynthesis for oxygen evolving organisms was then understood as: Light co2 + H20 [CHZO]+ 02 where [CHZO] represented a carbohydrate (e.g., glucose, a six-carbon sugar). A milestone contribution to the understanding of photosynthesis was that made by a microbiologist, Cornelius van Niel (1897-1985), who, based on his studies of purple and green bacteria, demonstrated that photosynthesis is essentially a light-dependent reaction in which hydrogen from a suitable oxidisable compound reduces carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. This can be expressed by: Light 2H2A+CO2 2A+CH2O+ H20 In green plants H20 is the hydrogen donor and is oxidised to 02. Some organisms do not release 02 during photosynthesis. When H28, instead is the hydrogen donor for purple and green sulphur bacteria, the ‘oxidation’ product is sulphur or sulphate depending on the organism and not 02. Hence, he inferred that the O2 evolved by the green plant comes from H20, not from carbon dioxide. This was later proved by using radioisotopic techniques. The correct equation, that would represent the overall process of photosynthesis is therefore: Light esco2 + 12H2O C6H1206 +6H20+ 602 where C6 H12 06 represents glucose. The 02 released is from water; this was proved using radio isotope techniques. Note that this is not a single 2019-2020"

About 97 per cent of O2 is transported by RBCs in the blood. The remaining 3 per cent of O2 is carried in a dissolved state through the plasma. Nearly 20-25 per cent of CO2 is transported by RBCs whereas 7 0 per cent of it is carried as bicarbonate. About 7 per cent of CO2 is carried in a dissolved state through plasma. 1? .4. 1 Transport of Oxygen Haemoglobin is a red coloured iron containing pigment present in the RBCs. 02 can bind with haemoglobin in a reversible manner to form oxyhaemoglobin. Each haemoglobin molecule can carry a maximum of four molecules of 02. Binding of oxygen with haemoglobin is primarily related to partial pressure of 02. Partial pressure of C02, hydrogen ion concentration and temperature are the other factors which can interfere with this binding. A sigmoid curve is obtained when percentage saturation of haemoglobin with O2 is plotted against the p02. This curve is called the Oxygen dissociation curve (Figure 17 .5) and is highly useful in studying the effect of factors like pCO2, H“ concentration, etc., on binding of 02 with haemoglobin.

physics/,"Pioneers of Thermodynamics Lord Kelvin (William Thomson) (1824-1907), born in Belfast. Ireland. is among the foremost British scientists of the nineteenth century. Thomson played a key role in the development of the law of conservation of energy suggested by the work of James Joule (1818—1889). Julius Mayer (1814— 1878) and Hermann Helmholtz (1821—1894). He collaborated with Joule on the so—called Joule-Thomson effect : cooling of a gas when it expands into vacuum. He introduced the notion of the absolute zero of temperature and proposed the absolute temperature scale. now called the Kelvin scale in his honour. From the work of Sadi Carnot [1796- 1832). Thomson arrived at a form of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Thomson was a versatile physicist. with notable contributions to electromagnetic theory and hydrodynamics. Rudolf Clausius (1822-1888). born in Poland. is generally regarded as the discoverer of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Based on the work of Caniot and Thomson. Clausius arrived at the important notion of entropy that led him to a fundamental version of the Second Law of Thermodynamics that. states that the entropy of an isolated system can never decrease. Clausius also worked on the kinetic theory of gases and obtained the first reliable estimates of molecular size. speed. mean free path. etc."
biology/,"312 BIOLOGY this. Joints are points of contact between bones, or between bones and cartilages. Force generated by the muscles is used to carry out movement through joints, where the joint acts as a fulcrum. The movability at these joints vary depending on different factors. Joints have been classiﬁed into three major structural forms, namely, ﬁbrous, cartilaginous and synovial. Fibrous joints do not allow any movement. This type of j oint is shown by the ﬂat skull bones which fuse end-to—end with the help of dense ﬁbrous connective tissues in the form of sutures, to form the cranium. In cartilaginous joints, the bones involved are joined together with the help of cartilages. The joint between the adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column is of this pattern and it permits limited movements. Synovial joints are characterised by the presence of a ﬂuid ﬁlled synovial cavity between the articulating surfaces of the two bones. Such an arragement allows considerable movement. These joints help in locomotion and many other movements. Ball and socket joint (between humerus and pectoral girdle), hinge joint (knee joint), pivot joint (between atlas and axis), gliding joint (between the carpals) and saddle joint (between carpal and metacarpal of thumb) are some examples. 20.5 DISORDERS 0F MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEM Myasthenia gravis: Auto immune disorder affecting neuromuscular junction leading to fatigue, weakening and paralysis of skeletal muscle. Muscular dystrophy: Progressive degeneration of skeletal muscle mostly due to genetic disorder. Tetany: Rapid spasms (wild contractions) in muscle due to low Ca++ in body ﬂuid. Arthritis: Inﬂammation of j oints. Osteoporosis: Age-related disorder characterised by decreased bone mass and increased chances of fractures. Decreased levels of estrogen is a common cause. Gout: Inﬂammation of j oints due to accumulation of uric acid crystals. SUMMARY Movement is an essential feature of all living beings.

As water evaporates into the intercellular spaces or the atmosphere, tension develop in the continuous stream of water in the apoplast, hence mass ﬂow of water occurs due to the adhesive and cohesive properties of water. The symplastic system is the system of interconnected protoplasts. Neighbouring cells are connected through cytoplasmic strands that extend through plasmodesmata. During symplastic movement, the water travels through the cells — their cytoplasm; intercellular movement is through the plasmodesmata. Water has to enter the cells through the cell membrane, hence the movement is relatively slower. Movement is again down a potential gradient. Symplastic movement may be aided by cytoplasmic streaming. You may have observed cytoplasmic streaming in cells of the Hydrilla leaf; the movement of chloroplast due to streaming is easily visible. Most of the water ﬂow in the roots occurs via the apoplast since the cortical cells are loosely packed, and hence offer no resistance to water movement. However, the inner boundary of the cortex, the endodermis, is impervious to water because of a band of suberised matrix called the casparian strip. Water molecules are unable to penetrate the layer, so they are directed to wall regions that are not suberised, into the cells proper through the membranes. The water then moves through the symplast and again crosses a membrane to reach the cells of the xylem. The movement of water through the root layers is ultimately symplastic in the endodermis. This is the only way water and other solutes can enter the vascular cylinder. Once inside the xylem, water is again free to move between cells as well as through them.

physics/,"186 P1 [YSICS — Central Forces We know the time rate of change of the angular momentum of a single particle about the origin is ﬂ=r><F dt The angular momentum of the particle is conserved, if the torque 4: : 1- x F due to the force F on it vanishes. This happens either when F is zero or when F is along r. We are interested in forces which satisfy the latter condition. Central forces satisfy this condition. A ‘central’ force is always directed towards or away from a ﬁxed point, i.e., along the position vector of the point of application of the force with respect to the fixed point. [See Figure below.) Further. the magnitude of a central force Fdepends on r, the distance of the point of application of the force from the fixed point; F = FIr). In the motion under a central force the angular momentum is always conserved. Two important results follow from this: [1] The motion of a particle under the central force is always confined to a plane. (2] The position vector of the particle with respect to the centre of the force (i.e. the fixed point] has a constant areal velocity. In other words the position vector sweeps out equal areas in equal times as the particle moves under the inﬂuence of the central force. Try to prove both these results. You may need to know that the areal velocity is given by : dA/dt = 1/2 r 1) sin a. An immediate application of the above discussion can be made to the motion of a planet under the gravitational force of the sun. For convenience the sun may be taken to be so heavy that it is at rest. The gravitational force of the sun on the planet is directed towards the sun. This force also satisfies the requirement F = F(r), since F = G m1m2/ r2 where m1 and m2 are respectively the masses of the planet and the sun and G is the universal constant of gravitation. The two results [I] and [2) described above, therefore, apply to the motion of the planet. In fact, the result [2) is the well—known second law of Kepler. Tr is the trejectory of the particle under the central force. At a position P, the force is directed along 0P, 0 is the centre of the force taken as the origin. In time At, the particle moves from P to P’, are PP’ = As = D At. The tangent PQ at P to the trajectory gives the direction of the velocity at P.

Their motion is very similar to the motion of planets around the Sun and hence Kepler’s laws of planetary motion are equally applicable to them. In particular, their orbits around the earth are circular or elliptic. Moon is the only natural satellite of the earth with a near circular orbit with a time period of approximately 27.3 days which is also roughly equal to the rotational period of the moon about 2019-20 its own axis. Since, 1957, advances in technology have enabled many countries including India to launch artificial earth satellites for practical use in fields like telecommunication, geophysics and meteorology. We will consider a satellite in a circular orbit of a distance (RE + h) from the centre of the earth, where RE = radius of the earth. If m is the mass of the satellite and Vits speed, the centripetal force required for this orbit is mV2 F(centripetal) = —( R + h) (8.33) E directed towards the centre. This centripetal force is provided by the gravitational force, which is G m M E F(gravitation) = m (8.34) E where ME is the mass of the earth. Equating R.H.S of Eqs. (8.33) and (8.34) and cancelling out m, we get G M V2 : E —(RE +h) (8.35) Thus V decreases as h increases. From equation (8.35),the speed V for h = O is V2 (h=0) = GM/RE = gRE (8.36) where we have used the relation g =GM/RE2. In every orbit, the satellite traverses a distance 27t(RE+ h) with speed V. Its time period Ttherefore is 272(RE + h) _ 27r(RE + m3” V \fG—IVIE (8.37) on substitution of value of V from Eq. (8.35). Squaring both sides of Eq.

For a satellite very close to the surface of earth h can be neglected in comparison to RE in Eq. (8.38). Hence, for such satellites, Tis T), where T0 = 271'JRE /g (8.39) If we substitute the numerical values g : 9.8 m s2 and RE = 6400 km., we get 6.4><106 T22""— ° 7‘ 9.8 S Which is approximately 85 minutes.

At the same time, we try to discover physical quantities, which do not change in a physical process. The laws of momentum and energy conservation are typical examples. In this section we shall apply these laws to a commonly encountered phenomena, namely collisions. Several games such as billiards, marbles or carrom involve collisions.We shall study the collision of two masses in an idealised form. Consider two masses m1 and m2. The particle m1 is moving with speed 1)”, the subscript ‘i’ implying initial. We can cosider m2 to be at rest. No loss of generality is involved in making such a selection. In this situation the mass m1 collides with the stationary mass m2 and this is depicted in Fig. 6.10. y /,0/L1f / m1 // ”1 .l_. g— m1 m2\ 92 x \ \ \ \ m2 U2f Fig. 6. 1 0 Collisionofmass m1, withastationmy mass m2. The masses m1 and m2 ﬂy-off in different directions. We shall see that there are relationships, which connect the masses, the velocities and the angles. 6.12.1 Elastic and Inelastic Collisions In all collisions the total linear momentum is conserved; the initial momentum of the system is equal to the final momentum of the system. One can argue this as follows. When two objects collide, the mutual impulsive forces acting over the collision time At cause a change in their respective momenta : Apl = F12 At Ap2 = F21 At where F12 is the force exerted on the first particle by the second particle. F21 is likewise the force exerted on the second particle by the ﬁrst particle. Now from Newton’s third law, F12 = — F21. This implies Ap1 + Ap2 = 0 The above conclusion is true even though the forces vary in a complex fashion during the collision time At. Since the third law is true at every instant, the total impulse on the ﬁrst object is equal and opposite to that on the second. On the other hand, the total kinetic energy of the system is not necessarily conserved. The impact and deformation during collision may generate heat and sound. Part of the initial ldnetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy. A useful way to visualise the deformation during collision is in terms of a ‘compressed spring’. If the ‘spring’ connecting the two masses regains its original shape without loss in energy, then the initial kinetic energy is equal to the ﬁnal kinetic energy but the kinetic energy during the collision time At is not constant. Such a collision is called an elastic collision. On the other hand the deformation may not be relieved and the two bodies could move together after the collision. A collision in which the two particles move together after the collision is called a completely inelastic collision. The intermediate case where the deformation is partly relieved and some of the initial kinetic energy is lost is more common and is appropriately called an inelastic collision. 6. 12.2 Collisions in One Dimension Consider first a completely inelastic collision in one dimension.

If an air mass is fully lifted above the land surface, it is called the occluded front. The fronts occur in middle latitudes and are characterised by steep gradient in temperature and pressure. They bring abrupt changes in temperature and cause the air to rise to form clouds and cause precipitation. Extra Tropical Cyclones The systems developing in the mid and high latitude, beyond the tropics are called the middle latitude or extra tropical cyclones. The passage of front causes abrupt changes in the weather conditions over the area in the middle and high latitudes. Extra tropical cyclones form along the polar front. Initially, the front is stationary. In the northern hemisphere, warm air blows from the south and cold air from the north of the front. When the pressure drops along the front, the warm air moves northwards and the cold air move towards, south setting in motion an FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY anticlockwise cyclonic circulation. The cyclonic circulation leads to a well developed extra tropical cyclone, with a warm front and a cold front. The plan and cross section of a well developed cyclone is given in Figure 10.9. There are pockets of warm air or warm sector wedged between the forward and the rear cold air or cold sector. The warm air glides over the cold air and a sequence of clouds appear over the sky ahead of the warm front and cause precipitation. The cold front approaches the warm air from behind and pushes the warm air up. As a result, cumulus clouds develop along the cold front. The cold front moves faster than the warm front ultimately overtaking the warm front. The warm air is completely lifted up and the front is occluded and the cyclone dissipates. The processes of wind circulation both at the surface and aloft are closely interlinked. The extra tropical cyclone differs from the tropical cyclone in number of ways. The extra tropical cyclones have a clear frontal system Figure 10. 9 : Extra tropical cyclones 2019-2020"
physics/,"MOTION IN A PLANE 85 — POINTS TO PONDER l. The path length traversed by an object between two points is. in general. not the same as the magnitude of displacement. The displacement depends only on the end points; the path length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path. The two quantities are equal only if the object does not change its direction during the course of motion. In all other cases. the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement. 2. In View of point 1 above. the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if the path length is equal to the magnitude of displacement. 3. The vector equations [4.3321] and (4.34a) do not involve any choice of axes. Of course, you can always resolve them along any two independent axes. 4.

Here v1 and v2 are velocities with reference to some common reference frame. 6. The resultant acceleration of an object in circular motion is towards the centre only if the speed is constant. 7. The shape of the trajectory of the motion of an object. is not determined by the acceleration alone but also depends on the initial conditions of motion [ initial position and initial velocity). For example. the trajectory of an object moving under the same acceleration due to gravity can be a straight line or a parabola depending on the initial conditions.

In regions of pronounced monsoonal ﬂow, the monsoon winds influence the current movements. Due to the coriolis force, the warm currents from low latitudes tend to move to the right in the northern hemisphere and to their left in the southern hemisphere. The oceanic circulation transports heat from one latitude belt to another in a manner similar to the heat transported by the general circulation of the atmosphere. The cold waters of the Arctic and Antarctic circles move towards warmer water in tropical and equatorial regions, while the warm waters of the lower latitudes move polewards. The major currents in the different oceans are shown in Figure14.3. Prepare a list of currents which are found in Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. How is the movement of currents inﬂuenced by prevailing winds? Give some examples from Figure 14.3. Effects of Ocean Currents Ocean currents have a number of direct and indirect inﬂuences on human activities. West coasts of the continents in tropical and subtropical latitudes (except close to the equator) are bordered by cool waters. Their average temperatures are relatively low with a narrow diurnal and annual ranges. There is fog, but generally the areas are arid. West coasts of the continents in the middle and higher latitudes are bordered by warm waters which cause a distinct marine climate. They are characterised by cool summers and relatively mild winters with a narrow annual range of temperatures. Warm currents ﬂow parallel to the east coasts of the continents in tropical and subtropical latitudes. This results in warm and rainy climates. These areas lie in the western margins of the subtropical anti-cyclones. The mixing of warm and cold currents help to replenish the oxygen and favour the growth of planktons, the primary food for fish population. The best fishing grounds of the world exist mainly in these mixing zones. 2019-2020"

(4.34a), i.e. d—lf gives Eq.(4.33a) and it also satisfies the condition that at t=0, r = r0. Equation (4.34a) can be written in component form as l x = x0 + voxt + Eaxt2 l y 2 yo + voyt + ant2 (4.34b) One immediate interpretation of Eq.(4.34b) is that the motions in x- and ydirections can be treated independently of each other. That is, motion in a plane (two-dimensions) can be treated as two separate simultaneous one-dimensional motions with constant acceleration along two perpendicular directions. This is an important result and is useful in analysing motion of objects in two dimensions. A similar result holds for three dimensions. The choice of perpendicular directions is convenient in many physical situations, as we shall see in section 4.10 for projectile motion. ’ Example 4.5 A particle starts from origin at t = O with a velocity 5.0 i m/s and moves in x—y plane under action of a force which produces a constant acceleration of (3.0i+2.0j) m/sz. (a) What is the y-coordinate of the particle at the instant its x—coordinate is 84 m ‘? (b) What is the speed of the particle at this time ? Answer From Eq. (4.34a) for ro= O, the position of the particle is given by 1 r (t) = vot+§at2 = 5.0it+(1/2)(3.0i+2.oj) t2 = (5.0t+ 1.5t2)i+ 1.0th Therefore, x (t) = 5.0t + 1.5t2 y(t)=+1.0t2 2019-20 Now, the velocity v = E = (5.0 + 3.0 t)i + 2.0t 3 At t= 6 s. v = 23.0i+12.oj speed = |v| = V232 + 122 5 26 m sT1_ { 4.9 REIATIVE VELOCITY IN TWO DIMENSIONS The concept of relative velocity, introduced in section 3.7 for motion along a straight line, can be easily extended to include motion in a plane or in three dimensions. Suppose that two objects A and B are moving with velocities vA and vB (each with respect to some common frame of reference, say ground.). Then, velocity of object A relative to that of B is : VAB= vA—vB (4.35a) and similarly, the velocity of object B relative to that ofA is : vBA = VB_ VA Therefore, vAB = — vBA (4.35b) and, MB] = vaA‘ (4.35c) b Example 4.6 Rain is falling vertically with a speed of 35 m 5‘1.

Answer In Fig. 4.16 vr represents the velocity of rain and vb , the velocity of the bicycle, the woman is riding. Both these velocities are with respect to the ground. Since the woman is riding a bicycle, the velocity of rain as experienced by Fig. 4.16 her is the velocity of rain relative to the velocity of the bicycle she is riding. That is vrb = vr— vb"
biology/,"BIOMOLECULES for every 10°C change in either direction. Catalysed reactions proceed at rates vastly higher than that of uncatalysed ones. When enzyme catalysed reactions are observed, the rate would be vastly higher than the same but uncatalysed reaction. For example Carbonic anhydrase CO2 + H20 H2CO3 carbon dioxide water carbonic acid In the absence of any enzyme this reaction is very slow, with about 200 molecules of H2CO3 being formed in an hour. However, by using the enzyme present within the cytoplasm called carbonic anhydrase, the reaction speeds dramatically with about 600,000 molecules being formed every second. The enzyme has accelerated the reaction rate by about 10 million times. The power of enzymes is incredible indeed! There are thousands of types of enzymes each catalysing a unique chemical or metabolic reaction. A multistep chemical reaction, when each of the steps is catalysed by the same enzyme complex or different enzymes, is called a metabolic pathway. For example, Glucose —> 2 Pyruvic acid C H O + 02—) 2C3H‘1 O3+2H20 6126 is actually a metabolic pathway in which glucose becomes pyruvic acid through ten different enzyme catalysed metabolic reactions. When you study respiration in Chapter 14 you will study these reactions. At this stage you should know that this very metabolic pathway with one or two additional reactions gives rise to a variety of metabolic end products. In our skeletal muscle, under anaerobic conditions, lactic acid is formed. Under normal aerobic conditions, pyruvic acid is formed. In yeast, during fermentation, the same pathway leads to the production of ethanol (alcohol). Hence, in different conditions different products are possible. 9.12.2 How do Enzymes bring about such High Rates of Chemical Conversions? To understand this we should study enzymes a little more. We have already understood the idea of an ‘active site’. The chemical or metabolic conversion refers to a reaction. The chemical which is converted into a product is called a ‘substrate’. Hence enzymes, i.e. proteins with three dimensional structures including an ‘active site’, convert a substrate (8) into a product (P). Symbolically, this can be depicted as: S—>P It is now understood that the substrate ‘8’ has to bind the enzyme at its ‘active site’ within a given cleft or pocket.

In dicotyledonous stems, cambium is present between phloem and xylem. Such vascular bundles because of the presence of cambium possess the ability to form secondary xylem and phloem tissues, and hence are called open vascular bundles. In the monocotyledons, the vascular bundles have no cambium present in them. Hence, since they do not form secondary tissues they are referred to as closed. When xylem and phloem within a vascular bundle are arranged in an alternate manner along the different radii, the arrangement is called radial such as in roots. In conjoint type of vascular bundles, the xylem and phloem are jointly situated along the same radius of vascular bundles. Such vascular bundles are common in stems and leaves. The conjoint vascular bundles usually have the phloem located only on the outer side of xylem. 6.3 ANATOMY OF DICOTYLEDONOUS AND MONOCOTYLEDONOUS PLANTS For a better understanding of tissue organisation of roots, stems and leaves, it is convenient to study the transverse sections of the mature zones of these organs. 6.3. 1 Dicotyledonous Root Look at Figure 6.6 (a), it shows the transverse section of the sunﬂower root.

biology/,"270 BIOLOGY lining whereas the inner pleural membrane is in contact with the lung surface. The part starting with the external nostrils up to the terminal bronchioles constitute the conducting part whereas the alveoli and their ducts form the respiratory or exchange part of the respiratory system. The conducting part transports the atmospheric air to the alveoli, clears it from foreign particles, humidiﬁes and also brings the air to body temperature. Exchange part is the site of actual diffusion of O2 and CO2 between blood and atmospheric air. The lungs are situated in the thoracic chamber which is anatomically an air-tight chamber. The thoracic chamber is formed dorsally by the vertebral column, ventrally by the sternum, laterally by the ribs and on the lower side by the dome-shaped diaphragm. The anatomical setup of lungs in thorax is such that any change in the volume of the thoracic cavity will be reﬂected in the lung (pulmonary) cavity. Such an arrangement is essential for breathing, as we cannot directly alter the pulmonary volume. Respiration involves the following steps: (1) Breathing or pulmonary ventilation by which atmospheric air is drawn in and CO2 rich alveolar air is released out. (ii) Diffusion of gases (O2 and 002) across alveolar membrane. (iii) Transport of gases by the blood. (iv) Diffusion of O2 and CO2 between blood and tissues. (v) Utilisation of 02 by the cells for catabolic reactions and resultant release of CO2 (cellular respiration as dealt in the Chapter 14). 17.2 MECHANISM OF BREATHING Breathing involves two stages : inspiration during which atmospheric air is drawn in and expiration by which the alveolar air is released out. The movement of air into and out of the lungs is carried out by creating a pressure gradient between the lungs and the atmosphere. Inspiration can occur if the pressure within the lungs (intra-pulmonary pressure) is less than the atmospheric pressure, i.e., there is a negative pressure in the lungs with respect to atmospheric pressure. Similarly, expiration takes place when the intra-pulmonary pressure is higher than the atmospheric pressure. The diaphragm and a specialised set of muscles — external and internal intercostals between the ribs, help in generation of such gradients. Inspiration is initiated by the contraction of diaphragm which increases the volume of thoracic chamber in the antero-posterior axis. The contraction of external inter-costal muscles lifts up the ribs and the"

physics/,"l92 PHYSICS If we associate a potential energy W(h) at a point at a height h above the surface such that W(h) = mgh + W0 (8.21) (where WO = constant) ; then it is clear that W12 = W(h) — W(hl) (8.22) The work done in moving the particle is just the difference of potential energy between its final and initial positions.Observe that the constant W0 cancels out in Eq. (8.22). Setting h = O in the last equation, we get W( h = O ) = W0. . h = 0 means points on the surface of the earth. Thus, W0 is the potential energy on the surface of the earth. If we consider points at arbitrary distance from the surface of the earth, the result just derived is not valid since the assumption that the gravitational force mg is a constant is no longer valid. However, from our discussion we know that a point outside the earth, the force of gravitation on a particle directed towards the centre of the earth is GM E m F= r2 (8.23) where ME = mass of earth, m = mass of the particle and r its distance from the centre of the earth. If we now calculate the work done in lifting a particle from r= r1 to r = r2 (r2 > r1) along a vertical path, we get instead of Eq. (8.20) GMm W12 2}: r2 dr 1 1 =-GME m [—-—J (8.24) r2 ’1 In place of Eq. (8.2 1), we can thus associate a potential energy W(r) at a distance r, such that G ME m r valid for r > R , so that once again W12 = W(r2) — W(rl). Setting r = infinity in the last equation, we get W ( r = infinity ) = W1. Thus, W1 is the potential energy at infinity. One should note that only the difference of potential energy between two points has a definite meaning from Eqs. (8.22) and (8.24). One conventionally sets W1 equal to zero, so that the potential energy at a point is just the amount of work done in displacing the particle from infinity to that point. W(r) =— +VVI, (8.25) 2019-20 We have calculated the potential energy at a point of a particle due to gravitational forces on it due to the earth and it is proportional to the mass of the particle. The gravitational potential due to the gravitational force of the earth is defined as the potential energy of a particle of unit mass at that point. From the earlier discussion, we learn that the gravitational potential energy associated with two particles of masses m1 and m2 separated by distance by a distance r is given by Gmlm2 r It should be noted that an isolated system of particles will have the total potential energy that equals the sum of energies (given by the above equation) for all possible pairs of its constituent particles.

physics/,"LAWS OF MOTION 5. 10. ll. The centripetal force should not be regarded as yet another kind of force. It is simply a name given to the force that provides inward radial acceleration to a body in circular motion. We should always look for some material force like tension. gravitational force. electrical force. friction. etc as the centripetal force in any circular motion. Static friction is a self—adjusting force up to its limit #5 N USS us N). Do not put f5: uSN without being sure that the maximum value of static friction is coming into play. The familiar equation mg = R for a body on a table is true only if the body is in equilibrium. The two forces mg and R can be different (eg. a body in an accelerated lift). The equality of mg and R has no connection with the third law. The terms ‘action' and ‘reaction' in the third Law of Motion simply stand for simultaneous mutual forces between a pair of bodies. Unlike their meaning in ordinary language. action does not precede or cause reaction. Action and reaction act on different bodies. The different terms like 'friction'. 'normal reaction' ‘tension‘. ‘air resistance”. 'viscous drag'. 'thrust'. ‘buoyancy'. ‘weight'. ‘centripetal force' all stand for ‘force' in different contexts. For clarity. every force and its equivalent terms encountered in mechanics should be reduced to the phrase ‘force on A by B‘. For applying the second law of motion. there is no conceptual distinction between inanimate and animate objects. An animate object such as a human also requires an external force to accelerate. For example, without the external force of friction, we cannot walk on the ground. The objective concept of force in physics should not be confused with the subjective concept of the ‘feeling of force”. On a merry—go—around. all parts of our body are subject to an inward force, but we have a feeling of being pushed outward — the direction of impending motion. 5.1 5.2 5.3 EXERCISES [For simplicity in numerical calculations, take 9 = 10 m s2) Give the magnitude and direction of the net force acting on (a) a drop of rain falling down with a constant speed, (b) a cork of mass 10 g ﬂoating on water, (c) a kite skillfully held stationary in the sky, [(1) a car moving with a constant velocity of 30 km/ h on a rough road, (e) a high-speed electron in space far from all material objects, and free of electric and magnetic fields.

The plains are utilised for agriculture. Plateaus provide forests and minerals. Mountains provide pastures, forests, tourist spots and are sources of rivers providing water to lowlands. Climate inﬂuences our house types, clothing and food habits. The climate has a profound effect on vegetation, cropping pattern, livestock farming and some industries, etc. Human beings have developed technologies which modify climatic elements in a restricted space such as air conditioners and coolers. Temperature and precipitation ensure the density of forests and quality of grassland. In India, monsoonal rainfall sets the agriculture rhythm in motion. Precipitation recharges the ground water aquifers which later provides water for agriculture and domestic use. We study oceans which are the store house of resources. Besides ﬁsh and other FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY sea-food, oceans are rich in mineral resources. India has developed the technology for collecting manganese nodules from oceanic bed. Soils are renewable resources, which inﬂuence a number of economic activities such as agriculture. The fertility of the soil is both naturally determined and culturally induced. Soils also provide the basis for the biosphere accommodating plants, animals and micro organisms. What is Geography? Geography is concerned with the description and explanation of the areal differentiation of the earth’s surface. Richard H artshome Geography studies the differences of phenomena usually related in different parts of the earth’s surface. Hettner The study of physical geography is emerging as a discipline of evaluating and managing natural resources. In order to achieve this objective, it is essential to understand the intricate relationship between physical environment and human beings. Physical environment provides resources, and human beings utilise these resources and ensure their economic and cultural development. Accelerated pace of resource utilisation with the help of modern technology has created ecological imbalance inthe world. Hence, a better understanding of physical environment is absolutely essential for sustainable development. 7 EXERCISES 7 1. Multiple choice questions.

biology/,"248 BIOLOGY The ‘bakanae’ (foolish seedling) disease of rice seedlings, was caused by a fungal pathogen Gibberellafujikuroi. E. Kurosawa (1926) reported the appearance of symptoms of the disease in rice seedlings when they were treated with sterile ﬁltrates of the fungus. The active substances were later identiﬁed as gibberellic acid. F. Skoog and his co-workers observed that from the internodal segments of tobacco stems the callus (a mass of undifferentiated cells) proliferated only if, in addition to auxins the nutrients medium was supplemented with one of the following: extracts of vascular tissues, yeast extract, coconut milk or DNA. Miller et al. (1955), later identiﬁed and crystallised the cytokinesis promoting active substance that they termed kinetin. During mid- 1960s, three independent researches reported the puriﬁcation and chemical characterisation of three different kinds of inhibitors: inhibitor-B, abscission II and dormin. Later all the three were proved to be chemically identical. It was named abscisic acid (ABA). H.H. Cousins (19 10) conﬁrmed the release of a volatile substance from ripened oranges that hastened the ripening of stored unripened bananas. Later this volatile substance was identiﬁed as ethylene, a gaseous PGR. Let us study some of the physiological effects of these ﬁve categories of PGRs in the next section. 15.4.3 Physiological Effects of Plant Growth Regulators 15.4.3.1 Auxins Auxins (from Greek ‘auxein’ : to grow) was ﬁrst isolated from human urine. The term ‘auxin’ is applied to the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and to other natural and synthetic compounds having certain growth regulating properties. They are generally produced by the growing apices of the stems and roots, from where they migrate to the regions of their action. Auxins like IAA and indole butyric acid (IBA) have been isolated from plants. NAA (naphthalene acetic acid) and 2, 4-D (2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic) are synthetic auxins. All these auxins have been used extensively in agricultural and horticultural practices. They help to initiate rooting in stem cuttings, an application widely used for plant propagation. Auxins promote ﬂowering e. g. in pineapples. They help to prevent fruit and leaf drop at early stages but promote the abscission of older mature leaves and fruits. In most higher plants, the growing apical bud inhibits the growth of the lateral (axillary) buds, a phenomenon called apical dominance. Removal of shoot tips (decapitation) usually results in the growth of lateral buds (Figure 15. 1 1). It is widely applied in tea plantations, hedge-making. Can you explain why?"
biology/,"NEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 2 1 .4. l Forebrain The forebrain consists of cerebrum, thalamus and hypothalamus (Figure 2 1.4). Cerebrum forms the major part of the human brain. A deep cleft divides the cerebrum longitudinally into two halves, which are termed as the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The hemispheres are connected by a tract of nerve ﬁbres called corpus callosum. The layer of cells which covers the cerebral hemisphere is called cerebral cortex and is thrown into prominent folds. The cerebral cortex is referred to as the grey matter due to its greyish appearance. The neuron cell bodies are concentrated here giving the colour. The cerebral cortex contains motor areas, sensory areas and large regions that are neither clearly sensory nor motor in function. These regions called as the association areas are responsible for complex functions like intersensory associations, memory and communication. Fibres of the tracts are covered with the myelin sheath, which constitute the inner part of cerebral hemisphere. They give an opaque white appearance to the layer and, hence, is called the white matter. The cerebrum wraps around a structure called thalamus, which is a major coordinating centre for sensory and motor signaling. Another very important part of the brain called hypothalamus lies at the base of the thalamus. The hypothalamus contains a number of centres which control body temperature, urge for eating and drinking. It also contains several groups of neurosecretory cells, which secrete hormones called hypothalamic hormones. The inner parts of cerebral hemispheres and a group of associated deep structures like amygdala, hippocampus, etc., form a complex structure called the limbic lobe or limbic system. Along with the hypothalamus, it is involved in the regulation of sexual behaviour, expression of emotional reactions (e.g., excitement, pleasure, rage and fear), and motivation. 2 l .4.2 Midbrain The midbrain is located between the thalamus / hypothalamus of the forebrain and pons of the hindbrain. A canal called the cerebral aqueduct passess through the midbrain. The dorsal portion of the midbrain consists mainly of four round swellings (lobes) called corpora quadrigemina. 2 1 .4. 3 Hindbrain The hindbrain comprises pons, cerebellum and medulla (also called the medulla oblongata). Pons consists of ﬁbre tracts that interconnect different regions of the brain. Cerebellum has very convoluted surface in order to provide the additional space for many more neurons. The medulla of the brain is connected to the spinal cord. The medulla contains centres which control respiration, cardiovascular reﬂexes and gastric secretions. Three major regions make up the brain stem; mid brain, pons and medulla oblongata. Brain stem forms the connections between the brain and spinal cord. 321"
biology/,"44 BIOLOGY The gymnosperms are the plants in which ovules are not enclosed by any ovary wall. After fertilisation the seeds remain exposed and therefore these plants are called naked-seeded plants. The gymnosperms produce microspores and megaspores which are produced in microsporangia and megasporangia borne on the sporophylls. The sporophylls — microsporophylls and megasporophylls — are arranged spirally on axis to form male and female cones, respectively. The pollen grain gerrninates and pollen tube releases the male gamete into the ovule, where it fuses with the egg cell in archegonia. Following fertilisation, the zygote develops into embryo and the ovules into seeds. In angiosperms, the male sex organs (stamen) and female sex organs (pistil) are borne in a ﬂower. Each stamen consists of a ﬁlament and an anther. The anther produces pollen grains (male gametophyte) after meiosis. The pistil consists of an ovary enclosing one to many ovules. Within the ovule is the female gametophyte or embryo sac which contains the egg cell. The pollen tube enters the embryo-sac where two male gametes are discharged. One male gamete fuses with egg cell (syngamy) and other fuses with diploid sec dary nucleus (tnple fusion).

physics/,"SYSTEMS OI’ PARTICLES AND ROTA'I‘IONAL MOTION We shall now define another product of two vectors. This product is a vector. Two important quantities in the study of rotational motion, namely, moment of a force and angular momentum, are defined as vector products. Deﬁnition of Vector Product A vector product of two vectors a and b is a vector c such that (i) magnitude of c = c = ab sin 0 where a and b are magnitudes of a and b and 6 is the angle between the two vectors. (ii) c is perpendicular to the plane containing a and b. (iii) if we take a right handed screw with its head lying in the plane of a and b and the screw perpendicular to this plane, and if we turn the head in the direction from a to b, then the tip of the screw advances in the direction of c. This right handed screw rule is illustrated in Fig. 7 . 15a. Alternately, if one curls up the fingers of right hand around a line perpendicular to the plane of the vectors a and b and if the fingers are curled up in the direction from a to b, then the stretched thumb points in the direction of c, as shown in Fig. 7.15b. Tc=axb I I ‘r :5 ‘J ‘1 v :5 v (a) (b) Fig. 7.15 (a) Rule of the right handed screw for defining the direction of the vector product of two vectors. (b) Rule of the right hand for deﬁning the direction of the vector product. A simpler version of the right hand rule is the following : Open up your right hand palm and curl the fingers pointing from a to b. Your stretched thumb points in the direction of c. It should be remembered that there are two angles between any two vectors a and b . In Fig. 7 .15 (a) or (b) they correspond to 6 (as shown) and (3600— 6). While applying either of the above rules, the rotation should be taken through the smaller angle (<1800) between a and b. It is 0 here. Because of the cross (x) used to denote the vector product, it is also referred to as cross product. 0 Note that scalar product of two vectors is commutative as said earlier, a.b = b.a The vector product, however, is not commutative, i.e. aXb #2 bXa The magnitude of both aXb and bXa is the same (ab sing): also, both of them are perpendicular to the plane of a and b. But the rotation of the right-handed screw in case of aXb is from a to b, whereas in case of bXa it is from b to a. This means the two vectors are in opposite directions. We have a x b = —b x a 0 Another interesting property of a vector product is its behaviour under reﬂection. Under reﬂection (i.e. on taking the plane mirror image) we have x —> —x,y —> —y and z —> —z. As a result all the components of a vector change sign and thus a —> —a, b —> —b . What happens to aXb under reﬂection? aXb—>(—a)><(—b)=a><b Thus, aXb does not change sign under reﬂection. 0 Both scalar and vector products are distributive with respect to vector addition. Thus, a.(b + c) = a.b + a.c ax(b+c)=a><b+a><c 0 We may write c = aXb in the component form. For this we first need to obtain some elementary cross products: (i) mm = 0 (0 is a null vector, i.e. a vector with zero magnitude) This follows since magnitude of aXa is a2 sin0°=0- 2019-20"

Estimation of the frequencies of normal modes of this system is more complex. This problem involves wave propagation in two dimensions. However, the underlying physics is the same.

For L = 30 cm and v = 330 m S'l, the fundamental frequency of the pipe closed at one end is 275 Hz and the source frequency corresponds to its fourth harmonic. Since this harmonic is not a possible mode, no resonance will be observed with the source, the moment one end is closed. 4 15.7 BEATS ‘Beats’ is an interesting phenomenon arising from interference of waves.

The tension of the string B is slightly increased and the beat frequency is found to decrease to 3 Hz. What is the original frequency of B if the frequency of A is 427 Hz ? Answer Increase in the tension of a string increases its frequency. If the original frequency of B (VB) were greater than that of A (VA), further increase in vB should have resulted in an increase in the beat frequency. But the beat frequency is found to decrease. This shows that vB < vA. Since vA— vB = 5 HZ, and VA = 427 Hz, we get VB = 422 HZ. 4 15.8 DOPPLER EFFECT It is an everyday experience that the pitch (or frequency) of the whistle of a fast moving train 2019-20 Reﬂection of sound in an open pipe When a high pressure pulse of air travelling down an open pipe reaches the other end, its momentum drags the air out into the open, where 7 pressure falls rapidly to the ~' atmospheric pressure. As a result the air following after it in the tube is pushed out. The low pressure at the end of the tube draws air from further up the tube. The air gets drawn towards the open end forcing the low pressure region to move upwards. As a result a pulse of high pressure air travelling down the tube turns into a pulse of low pressure air travelling up the tube. We say a pressure wave has been reﬂected at the open end with a change in phase of 180°. Standing waves in an open pipe organ like the ﬂute is a result of this phenomenon. Compare this with what happens when a pulse of high pressure air arrives at a closed end: it collides and as a result pushes the air back in the opposite direction. Here. we say that the pressure wave is reﬂected. with no change in phase. decreases as it recedes away. When we approach a stationary source of sound with high speed, the pitch of the sound heard appears to be higher than that of the source. As the observer recedes away from the source, the observed pitch (or frequency) becomes lower than that of the source. This motion-related frequency change is called Doppler effect. The Austrian physicist Johann Christian Doppler first proposed the effect in 1842. Buys Ballot in Holland tested it experimentally in 1845. Doppler effect is a wave phenomenon, it holds not only for sound waves but also for electromagnetic waves. However, here we shall consider only sound waves. We shall analyse changes in frequency under three different situations: (1) observer is"

Therefore, the two objects stay at a constant distance (x8 (0) — xA (0)) apart, and their position—time graphs are straight lines parallel to each other as shown in Fig. 3.16. The relative velocity DAB or vBA is zero in this case. (b) If vA > v8, v3 — vA is negative. One graph is steeper than the other and they meet at a common point. For example, suppose vA = 20 m s‘1 and xA (O) = 10 m; and vB = 10 m s‘1,xB(O) = 40 m; then the time at which they meet is t = 3 s (Fig. 3.17). At this instant they are both at a position xA (t) = xB (t) = 70 m. Thus, object A overtakes object B at this time. In this case = 10m sr1 — 20m s*1 = — 10 m s*1=— DAB.

biology/,"154 BioquY 9. 12 ENZYMES Almost all enzymes are proteins. There are some nucleic acids that behave like enzymes. These are called ribozymes. One can depict an enzyme by a line diagram. An enzyme like any protein has a primary structure, i.e., amino acid sequence of the protein. An enzyme like any protein has the secondary and the tertiary structure. When you look at a tertiary structure (Figure 9.4 b) you will notice that the backbone of the protein chain folds upon itself, the chain criss-crosses itself and hence, many crevices or pockets are made. One such pocket is the ‘active site’. An active site of an enzyme is a crevice or pocket into which the substrate fits. Thus enzymes, through their active site, catalyse reactions at a high rate. Enzyme catalysts differ from inorganic catalysts in many ways, but one major difference needs mention. Inorganic catalysts work efficiently at high temperatures and high pressures, while enzymes get damaged at high temperatures (say above 40°C). However, enzymes isolated from organisms who normally live under extremely high temperatures (e. g., hot vents and sulphur springs), are stable and retain their catalytic power even at high temperatures (upto 80°—90°C). Thermal stability is thus an important quality of such enzymes isolated from thermophilic organisms. 9. 12. 1 Chemical Reactions How do we understand these enzymes? Let us first understand a chemical reaction. Chemical compounds undergo two types of changes. A physical change simply refers to a change in shape without breaking of bonds. This is a physical process. Another physical process is a change in state of matter: when ice melts into water, or when water becomes a vapour. These are also physical processes. However, when bonds are broken and new bonds are formed during transformation, this will be called a chemical reaction. For example: Ba(OH)2 + H2804 —> BaSO4 + 2H2O is an inorganic chemical reaction. Similarly, hydrolysis of starch into glucose is an organic chemical reaction. Rate of a physical or chemical process refers to the amount of product formed per unit time. It can be expressed as: 6 P rate — — 6: Rate can also be called velocity if the direction is specified. Rates of physical and chemical processes are inﬂuenced by temperature among other factors. A general rule of thumb is that rate doubles or decreases by half 2019-2020"

They are widely used as herbicides. 2, 4—D, widely used to kill dicotyledonous weeds, does not affect mature monocotyledonous plants. It is used to prepare weed-free lawns by gardeners. Auxin also controls xylem differentiation and helps in cell division. 1 5. 4.3.2 Gibberellins Gibberellins are another kind of promotory PGR. There are more than 100 gibberellins reported from widely different organisms such as fungi and higher plants. They are denoted Figure 15.11 Apical dominance in plants : as GAI. GAZ. GA3 and so on.

All GAS are branChes after decapitation acidic. They produce a wide range of physiological responses in the plants. Their ability to cause an increase in length of axis is used to increase the length of grapes stalks. Gibberellins, cause fruits like apple to elongate and improve its shape. They also delay senescence. Thus, the fruits can be left on the tree longer so as to extend the market period. GA3 is used to speed up the malting process in brewing industry. Sugarcane stores carbohydrate as sugar in their stems. Spraying sugarcane crop with gibberellins increases the length of the stem, thus increasing the yield by as much as 20 tonnes per acre. Spraying juvenile conifers with GAS hastens the maturity period, thus leading to early seed production. Gibberellins also promotes bolting (intemode elongation just prior to ﬂowering) in beet, cabbages and many plants with rosette habit. 1 5.4.3.3 Cytokinins Cytokinins have speciﬁc effects on cytokinesis, and were discovered as kinetin (a modiﬁed form of adenine, a purine) from the autoclaved herring sperm DNA. Kinetin does not occur naturally in plants. Search for natural substances with cytokinin-like activities led to the isolation of zeatin from corn-kernels and coconut milk. Since the discovery of zeatin, several naturally occurring cytokinins, and some synthetic compounds with cell division promoting activity, have been identiﬁed. Natural cytokinins are synthesised in regions where rapid cell division occurs, for example, root apices, developing shoot buds, young fruits etc. It helps to produce new"

The position of the object can be specified with reference to a conveniently chosen origin. For motion in a straight line, position to the right of the origin is taken as positive and to the left as negative. Path length is defined as the total length of the path traversed by an object. Displacement is the change in position 2 Ax = x2 — x1. Path length is greater or equal to the magnitude of the displacement between the same points. An object is said to be in uniform motion in a straight line if its displacement is equal in equal intervals of time. Otherwise, the motion is said to be non—uniform. Average velocity is the displacement divided by the time interval in which the displacement occurs : _ Ax v 2 _ At On an x—t graph, the average velocity over a time interval is the slope of the line connecting the initial and final positions corresponding to that interval. Average Speed is the ratio of total path length traversed and the corresponding time interval. The average speed of an object is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval.

You know that living organisms of the earth, constituting the biosphere, interact with other environmental realms. The biosphere includes all the living components of the earth. It consists of all plants and animals, including all the micro- Life on the earth is found almost everywhere. Living organisms are found from the poles to the equator, from the bottom of the sea to several km in the air, from freezing waters to dry valleys, from under the sea to underground water lying below the earth’s surface. organisms that live on the planet earth and their interactions with the surrounding environment. Most of the organisms exist on the lithosphere and / or the hydrosphere as well as in the atmosphere. There are also many organisms that move freely from one realm to the other. The biosphere and its components are very significant elements of the environment. These elements interact with other components of the natural landscape such as land, water and soil. They are also influenced by the atmospheric elements such as the temperature, rainfall, moisture and sunlight. The interactions of biosphere with land, air and water are important to the growth, development and evolution of the organism. CHAPTER ECOLOGY You have been reading about ecological and environmental problems in newspapers and magazines. Have you ever thought what ecology is? The environment as you know, is made up of abiotic and biotic components. It would be interesting to understand how the diversity of life-forms is maintained to bring a kind of balance. This balance is maintained in a particular proportion so that a healthy interaction between the biotic and the abiotic components goes on. The interactions of a particular group of organisms with abiotic factors within a particular habitat resulting in clearly deﬁned energy ﬂows and material cycles on land, water and air, are called ecological systems. The term ecology is derived from the Greek word ‘oikos’ meaning ‘house’, combined with the word ‘logy’ meaning the ‘science of or ‘the study of’. Literally, ecology is the study of the earth as a ‘household’, of plants, human beings, animals and micro-organisms. They all live together as interdependent components. A German zoologist Ernst Haeckel, who used the term as ‘oekologie’ in 1869, became the first person to use the term ‘ecology’. The study of interactions between life forms (biotic) and the physical environment (abiotic) is the science of ecology. Hence, ecology can be defined as a scientific study of the interactions of organisms with their physical environment and with each other. 2019-2020"
physics/,"MECllANlCAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 25l chest a large, light but strong wooden plank is placed first, is saved from this accident. Such everyday experiences convince us that both the force and its coverage area are important. Smaller the area on which the force acts, greater is the impact. This impact is known as pressure. When an object is submerged in a ﬂuid at rest, the ﬂuid exerts a force on its surface. This force is always normal to the object’s surface. This is so because if there were a component of force parallel to the surface, the object will also exert a force on the ﬂuid parallel to it; as a consequence of Newton’s third law. This force will cause the ﬂuid to ﬂow parallel to the surface. Since the ﬂuid is at rest, this cannot happen. Hence, the force exerted by the ﬂuid at rest has to be perpendicular to the surface in contact with it. This is shown in Fig. 10.1(a). The normal force exerted by the ﬂuid at a point may be measured. An idealised form of one such pressure-measuring device is shown in Fig. 10. 1 (b). It consists of an evacuated chamber with a spring that is calibrated to measure the force acting on the piston. This device is placed at a point inside the ﬂuid. The inward force exerted by the ﬂuid on the piston is balanced by the outward spring force and is thereby measured. (a) [b] Fig. 10.1 (a) The force exerted by the liquid in the beaker on the submerged object or on the walls is normal (perpendicular) to the surface at all points. (b) An idealised device for measuring pressure. If Fis the magnitude of this normal force on the piston of area A then the average pressure Pay is defined as the normal force acting per unit area. F P :— an A (10.1) In principle, the piston area can be made arbitrarily small. The pressure is then defined in a limiting sense as lim AF Pressure is a scalar quantity. We remind the reader that it is the component of the force normal to the area under consideration and not the (vector) force that appears in the numerator in Eqs. (10.1) and (10.2). Its dimensions are [ML—1T2]. The S1 unit of pressure is N m‘2. It has been named as pascal (Pa) in honour of the French scientist Blaise Pascal (1623- 1662) who carried out pioneering studies on ﬂuid pressure. A common unit of pressure is the atmosphere (atm), i.e. the pressure exerted by the atmosphere at sea level (1 atm = 1.013 x 105 Pa). Another quantity, that is indispensable in describing ﬂuids, is the density p. For a ﬂuid of mass m occupying volume V, —2- now p—V - The dimensions of density are [ML—3]. Its SI unit is kg m‘3. It is a positive scalar quantity. A liquid is largely incompressible and its density is therefore, nearly constant at all pressures. Gases, on the other hand exhibit a large variation in densities with pressure. The density of water at 4°C (277 K) is 1.0 x 103 kg m‘3. The relative density of a substance is the ratio of its density to the density of water at 4°C. It is a dimensionless positive scalar quantity. For example the relative density of aluminium is 2.7. Its density is 2.7 x 103 kg m‘3. The densities of some common ﬂuids are displayed in Table 10.1.

physics/,"Founders of Kinetic Theory of Gases James Clerk Maxwell (1831 — 1879). born in Edinburgh. Scotland. was among the greatest physicists of the nineteenth century. He derived the thermal velocity distribution of molecules in a gas and was among the first to obtain reliable estimates of molecular parameters from measurable quantities like viscosity. etc. Maxwell's greatest achievement was the unification of the laws of electricity and magnetism (discovered by Coulomb. Oersted. Ampere and Faraday) into a consistent set of equations now called Maxwell's equations. From these he arrived at the most important conclusion that light is an electromagnetic wave. Interestingly. Maxwell did not agree with the idea [strongly suggested by the Faraday's laws of electrolysis] that electricity was particulate in nature. Ludwig Boltzmann (1844 — 1906) born in Vienna. Austria. worked on the kinetic theory of gases independently of Mamvell. A firm advocate of atomism. that is basic to kinetic theory.

biology/,"276 BIOLOGY Occupational Respiratory Disorders: In certain industries, especially those involving grinding or stone-breaking, so much dust is produced that the defense mechanism of the body cannot fully cope with the situation. Long exposure can give rise to inﬂammation leading to ﬁbrosis (proliferation of ﬁbrous tissues) and thus causing serious lung damage. Workers in such industries should wear protective masks. SUMMARY Cells utilise oxygen for metabolism and produce energy along with substances like carbon dioxide which is harmful. Animals have evolved different mechanisms for the transport of oxygen to the cells and for the removal of carbon dioxide from there. We have a well developed respiratory system comprising two lungs and associated air passages to perform this function. The ﬁrst step in respiration is breathing by which atmospheric air is taken in (inspiration) and the alveolar air is relegeél‘nut (expiration) Exchange of O2 and CO2 between deoxygenated blood and alve'qh, transpoit of these gases throughout the2 body by blood, exchange 0&0?"" d 6202 betweenrth’e oxygenated blood and tissues and utilisation of O 2b3f the cell‘s (cellular respiratlon) are the other steps involved. ‘7 r. .. ‘ Inspiration and exprnatlmn between the atmosphere a‘itld the alvedll- intercostals and diaphragm Volumes‘ ref air involved in these activities can be estimated with therhejpl of spirometer and are of clinical signiﬁcance. Exchange of 62 arfd CO2 at the’alYeoll and tissues occur by diffusion. Rate of diffusion 1s dependent on the‘pa’rrtlal pressure gradients of 02 (p02) and CO2 (pCO2 ), their solubility as well as thel‘vthickness of the diffusion surface. These factors in our body facilitate d1ffus1on of 02 from the alveoli to the deoxygenated blood as well as from the oxy enated blood2 to the tissues. The factors are favourable for the diffusion of CO2 in? e/eppOSIte direction, 1. e., from tissues to alveoli. Oxygen 1s transported mainly as oxyhaemoglobin. In the alveoli where p02 is higher, 02 gets bound to haemoglobin which is easily dissociated at the tissues where p02 is low and pCO2 and H’“ concentration are high. Nearly 7 0 per cent of carbon dioxide is transported as bicarbonate (HCOQ with the help of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. 20-25 per cent of carbon dioxide is carried by haemoglobin as carbamino-haemoglobin. In the tissues where pCO2 is high, it gets bound to blood whereas in the alveoli where pCO2 is low and p02 is high, it gets removed from the blood. Respiratory rhythm is maintained by the respiratory centre in the medulla region of brain. A pneumotaxic centre in the pons region of the brain and a chemosensitive area in the medulla can alter respiratory mechanism."
biology/,"PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 15.2 DIFFERENTIATION, DEDIFFERENTIATION AND REDIFFERENTIATION The cells derived from root apical and shoot-apical meristems and cambium differentiate and mature to perform speciﬁc functions. This act leading to maturation is termed as differentiation. During differentiation, cells undergo few to major structural changes both in their cell walls and protoplasm. For example, to form a tracheary element, the cells would lose their protoplasm. They also develop a very strong, elastic, lignocellulosic secondary cell walls, to carry water to long distances even under extreme tension. Try to correlate the various anatomical features you encounter in plants to the functions they perform. Plants show another interesting phenomenon. The living differentiated cells, that by now have lost the capacity to divide can regain the capacity of division under certain conditions. This phenomenon is termed as dedifferentiation. For example, formation of meristems — interfascicular cambium and cork cambium from fully differentiated parenchyma cells. While doing so, such meristems / tissues are able to divide and produce cells that once again lose the capacity to divide but mature to perform speciﬁc functions, i.e., get redifferentiated. List some of the tissues in a woody dicotyledenous plant that are the products of redifferentiation. How would you describe a tumour? What would you call the parenchyma cells that are made to divide under controlled laboratory conditions during plant tissue culture? Recall, in Section 15. 1. 1, we have mentioned that the grth in plants is open, i.e., it can be indeterminate or determinate. Now, we may say that even differentiation in plants is open, because cells / tissues arising out of the same meristem have different structures at maturity. The final structure at maturity of a cell / tissue is also determined by the location of the cell within. For example, cells positioned away from root apical meristems differentiate as root-cap cells, while those pushed to the periphery mature as epidermis. Can you add a few more examples of open differentiation correlating the position of a cell to its position in an organ? 1 5.3 DEVELOPMENT Development is a term that includes all changes that an organism goes through during its life cycle from germination of the seed to senescence. Diagrammatic representation of the sequence of processes which constitute the development of a cell of a higher plant is given in Figure 15.8. It is also applicable to tissues / organs. 245"
physics/,"108 PHYSICS — In simple terms, the law can be stated thus : Forces in nature always occur between pairs of bodies. Force on a body A by body B is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A. Action and reaction forces are simultaneous forces. There is no cause-effect relation between action and reaction. Any of the two mutual forces can be called action and the other reaction. Action and reaction act on different bodies and so they cannot be cancelled out. The internal action and reaction forces between different parts of a body do, however, sum to zero. 7. Law of Conservation ofMomentum The total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved. The law follows from the second and third law of motion. 8. Friction Frictional force opposes (impending or actual) relative motion between two surfaces in contact. It is the component of the contact force along the common tangent to the surface in contact. Static friction fS opposes impending relative motion; kinetic friction fk opposes actual relative motion. They are independent of the area of contact and satisfy the following approximate laws : fs S (fslmaX = :usR f k = ”kR us (co—efficient of static friction) and uk [co-efficient of kinetic friction) are constants characteristic of the pair of surfaces in contact.

Force is not always in the direction of motion. Depending on the situation. F may be along v. opposite to v. nomlal to v or may make some other angle with v. In every case. it is parallel to acceleration. 2. va = 0 at an instant, i.e. ifa body is momentarily at rest. it does not mean that force or acceleration are necessarily zero at that instant. For example. when a ball thrown upward reaches its maximum height. v = 0 but the force continues to be its weight mg and the acceleration is not zero but g. 3. Force on a body at a given time is determined by the situation at the location of the body at that time. Force is not 'carried' by the body from its earlier history of motion. The moment after a stone is released out of an accelerated train. there is no horizontal force (or acceleration) on the stone, if the effects of the surrounding air are neglected. The stone then has only the vertical force of gravity. 4. In the second law of motion F = m a. F stands for the net force due to all material agencies external to the body. a is the effect of the force. ma should not be regarded as yet another force. besides F. 2019-20"

The result of a measurement of a physical quantity is expressed by a number (or numerical measure) accompanied by a unit. Although the number of physical quantities appears to be very large, we need only a limited number of units for expressing all the physical quantities, since they are inter- related with one another. The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called fundamental or base units. The units of all other physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the derived quantities are called derived units. A complete set of these units, both the base units and derived units, is known as the system of units. 2.2 THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS In earlier time scientists of different countries were using different systems of units for measurement. Three such systems, the CGS, the FPS (or British) system and the MKS system were in use extensively till recently. The base units for length, mass and time in these systems were as follows : 0 In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second respectively. 0 In FPS system they were foot, pound and second respectively. 0 In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second respectively. The system of units which is at present internationally accepted for measurement is the Systeme Internationale d’ Unites (French for International System of Units), abbreviated as SI. The SI, with standard scheme of symbols, units and abbreviations, was developed and recommended by General Conference on Weights and Measures in 197 1 for 2019-20"
physics/,"lOO PHYSICS Answer Figures 5.8(b) and 5.8(c) are known as free-body diagrams. Figure 5.8(b) is the free-body diagram of W and Fig. 5.8(c) is the free-body diagram of point P. Consider the equilibrium of the weight W. Clearly,T2 = 6 X 10 = 60 N. Consider the equilibrium of the point P under the action of three forces - the tensions T1 and T2, and the horizontal force 50 N. The horizontal and vertical components of the resultant force must vanish separately : Tlcos0= T2 = SON T sin 0 = 50 N 1 which gives that tan0 = E or 6 = tan""1 (5) = 40° 6 6 Note the answer does not depend on the length of the rope (assumed massless) nor on the point at which the horizontal force is applied. 4 5.9 COMMON FORCES IN MECHANICS In mechanics, we encounter several kinds of forces. The gravitational force is, of course, pervasive. Every object on the earth experiences the force of gravity due to the earth. Gravity also governs the motion of celestial bodies. The gravitational force can act at a distance without the need of any intervening medium. All the other forces common in mechanics are contact forcesf'< As the name suggests, a contact force on an object arises due to contact with some other object: solid or ﬂuid. When bodies are in contact (e. g. a book resting on a table, a system of rigid bodies connected by rods, hinges and kx mg other types of supports), there are mutual contact forces (for each pair of bodies) satisfying the third law. The component of contact force normal to the surfaces in contact is called normal reaction. The component parallel to the surfaces in contact is called friction. Contact forces arise also when solids are in contact with ﬂuids. For example, for a solid immersed in a ﬂuid, there is an upward bouyant force equal to the weight of the ﬂuid displaced. The viscous force, air resistance, etc are also examples of contact forces (Fig. 5.9). Two other common forces are tension in a string and the force due to spring. When a spring is compressed or extended by an external force, a restoring force is generated. This force is usually proportional to the compression or elongation (for small displacements). The spring force F is written as F = — k x where x is the displacement and k is the force constant. The negative sign denotes that the force is opposite to the displacement from the unstretched state. For an inextensible string, the force constant is very high. The restoring force in a string is called tension. It is customary to use a constant tension Tthroughout the string. This assumption is true for a string of negligible mass. In Chapter 1, we learnt that there are four fundamental forces in nature. Of these, the weak and strong forces appear in domains that do not concern us here. Only the gravitational and electrical forces are relevant in the context of mechanics. The different contact forces of mechanics mentioned above fundamentally arise from electrical forces. This may seem surprising Fig. 5.9 Some examples of contact forces in mechanics. * We are not considering, for simplicity, charged and magnetic bodies. For these, besides gravity, there are electrical and magnetic non—contact forces. 2019-20"
physics/,"252 PHYSICS Example 1 0. 1 The two thigh bones (femurs). each of cross-sectional arealO cm2 support the upper part ofa human body of mass 40 kg. Estimate the average pressure sustained by the femurs. Answer Total cross-sectional area of the femurs is A = 2 x 10 em2 = 20 x 10'4 m2. The force acting on them is F = 40 kg wt = 400 N (taking 9 = 10 m S'2). This force is acting vertically down and hence, normally on the femurs. Thus, the average pressure is Pau=%=2><105Nm_2 4 10.2. 1 Pascal's Law The French scientist Blaise Pascal observed that the pressure in a ﬂuid at rest is the same at all points if they are at the same height. This fact may be demonstrated in a simple way. Fig. 10.2 Proof of Pascal’s law. ABC—DEF is an element of the interior of a ﬂuid at rest. This element is in the form of a right— angled prism The element is small so that the effect of gravity can be ignored, but it has been enlarged for the sake of clarity. Fig. 10.2 shows an element in the interior of a ﬂuid at rest. This element ABC-DEF is in the form of a right-angled prism. In principle, this prismatic element is very small so that every part of it can be considered at the same depth from the liquid surface and therefore, the effect of the gravity is the same at all these points. But for clarity we have enlarged this element. The forces on this element are those exerted by the rest of the ﬂuid and they must be normal to the surfaces of the element as discussed above. Thus, the ﬂuid exerts pressures Pa, Pb and PC on 2019-20 this element of area corresponding to the normal forces Fa, Fb and Fe as shown in Fig. 10.2 on the faces BEFC, ADFC and ADEB denoted by Aa, Ab and AC respectively. Then Fb sine = F0, Fb cosB = Fa (by equilibrium) Ab sine = AC, Ab cost) = A3 (by geometry) Thus, F b _ F c _ Fa . Ab AC Aa ’ Hence, pressure exerted is same in all directions in a ﬂuid at rest. It again reminds us that like other types of stress, pressure is not a vector quantity. No direction can be assigned to it. The force against any area within (or bounding) a ﬂuid at rest and under pressure is normal to the area, regardless of the orientation of the area. Now consider a ﬂuid element in the form of a horizontal bar of uniform cross-section. The bar is in equilibrium. The horizontal forces exerted at its two ends must be balanced or the pressure at the two ends should be equal. This proves that for a liquid in equilibrium the pressure is same at all points in a horizontal plane. Suppose the pressure were not equal in different parts of the ﬂuid, then there would be a ﬂow as the ﬂuid will have some net force acting on it. Hence in the absence of ﬂow the pressure in the ﬂuid must be same everywhere in a horizontal plane. Pb = Pa = Pa (10.4) 10.2.2 Variation of Pressure with Depth Consider a ﬂuid at rest in a container. In Fig. 10.3 point 1 is at height h above a point 2. The pressures at points 1 and 2 are P1 and P2 respectively. Consider a cylindrical element of ﬂuid having area of base A and height h. As the ﬂuid is at rest the resultant horizontal forces should be zero and the resultant vertical forces should balance the weight of the element. The forces acting in the vertical direction are due to the ﬂuid pressure at the top (PIA) acting downward, at the bottom (P2A) acting upward. If mg is weight of the ﬂuid in the cylinder we have (P2—P1) A = mg (10.5) Now, if p is the mass density of the ﬂuid, we have the mass of ﬂuid to be m = pV= phA so that P2 —P1= pgh (10.6)"

He observed that the motion of the chandelier was periodic. The system is a kind of pendulum. You can also make your own pendulum by tying a piece of stone to a long unstretchable thread, approximately 100 cm long. Suspend your pendulum from a suitable support so that it is free to oscillate. Displace the stone to one side by a small distance and let it go. The stone executes a to and fro motion, it is periodic with a period of about two seconds. We shall show that this periodic motion is simple harmonic for small displacements from the mean position. Consider simple pendulum — a small bob of mass m tied to an inextensible massless string of length L. The other end of the string is fixed to a rigid support. The bob oscillates in a plane about the vertical line through the support. Fig. 14.18(a) shows this system.

biology/,"280 BIOLOGY associated with allergic reactions. Lymphocytes (20-25 per cent) are of two major types — ‘B’ and ”1"" forms. Both B and T lymphocytes are responsible for immune responses of the body. Platelets also called thrombocytes, are cell fragments produced from megakaryocytes (special cells in the bone marrow). Blood normally contains 1 ,500,00-3,500,00 platelets mm*3. Platelets can release avariety of substances most of which are involved in the coagulation or clotting of blood. A reduction in their number can lead to clotting disorders which will lead to excessive loss of blood from the body. 18. 1 .3 Blood Groups As you know, blood of human beings differ in certain aspects though it appears to be similar. Various types of grouping of blood has been done. Two such groupings — the ABC and Rh — are widely used all over the world. 18.1.3.1 ABO grouping ABO grouping is based on the presence or absence of two surface antigens (chemicals that can induce immune response) on the RBCs namely A and B. Similarly, the plasma of different individuals contain two natural antibodies (proteins produced in response to antigens). The distribution of antigens and antibodies in the four groups of blood, A. B, AB and O are given in Table l 8. 1. You probably know that during blood transfusion, any blood cannot be used; the blood of a donor has to be carefully matched with the blood of a recipient before any blood transfusion to avoid severe problems of clumping (destruction of RBC). The donor’s compatibility is also shown in the Table 18.1.

Persons with ‘AB’ group can accept blood from persons with AB as well as the other groups of blood. Therefore, such persons are called ‘universal recipients’. 2019-2020"
physics/,"260 PHYSICS If the cross-sectional area of the tank A2 is much larger than that of the hole (A2 >>A1), then we may take the ﬂuid to be approximately at rest at the top, i.e., v2 = 0. Now, applying the Bernoulli equation at points 1 and 2 and noting that at the hole P1 = Pa, the atmospheric pressure, we have from Eq. (10.12) 1 Pa +§pv12+ pgy1=P+p gyz Taking y2 — y1 = hwe have 2 (P _ Pa) v1= 29 MT (10.14) When P >>Pa and 2 g h may be ignored, the speed of efﬂux is determined by the container pressure. Such a situation occurs in rocket propulsion. On the other hand, if the tank is open to the atmosphere, then P = Pa and v1=,)2gh (10.15) This is also the speed of a freely falling body. Equation (1 O. 1 5) represents Torricelli’s law. 10.4.2 Venturi-meter The Venturi-meter is a device to measure the ﬂow speed of incompressible ﬂuid. It consists of a tube with a broad diameter and a small constriction at the middle as shown in Fig. (10.11). A manometer in the form of a U-tube is also attached to it, with one arm at the broad neck point of the tube and the other at constriction as shown in Fig. (10.11). The manometer contains a liquid of density pm. The speed v1 of the liquid ﬂowing through the tube at the broad neck area A is to be measured from equation of continuity Eq. (10. 10) the speed A at the constriction becomes 02 =—Ul.

biology/,"BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASES of CO2 from carbamino-haemoglobin takes place, i.e., CO2 which is bound to haemoglobin from the tissues is delivered at the alveoli. RBCs contain a very high concentration of the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase and minute quantities of the same is present in the plasma too. This enzyme facilitates the following reaction in both directions. At the tissue site where partial pressure of CO2 is high due to catabolism, CO2 diffuses into blood (RBCs and plasma) and forms HCO; and H’“. At the alveolar site where pCO2 is low, the reaction proceeds in the opposite direction leading to the formation of CO2 and H20. Thus, CO2 trapped as bicarbonate at the tissue level and transported to the alveoli is released out as CO2 (Figure 17 .4). Every 100 ml of deoxygenated blood delivers approximately 4 ml of CO2 to the alveoli. 17.5 REGULATION OF RESPIRATION Human beings have a signiﬁcant ability to maintain and moderate the respiratory rhythm to suit the demands of the body tissues. This is done by the neural system. A specialised centre present in the medulla region of the brain called respiratory rhythm centre is primarily responsible for this regulation. Another centre present in the pons region of the brain called pneumotaxic centre can moderate the functions of the respiratory rhythm centre. Neural signal from this centre can reduce the duration of inspiration and thereby alter the respiratory rate. A chemosensitive area is situated adjacent to the rhythm centre which is highly sensitive to CO2 and hydrogen ions. Increase in these substances can activate this centre, which in turn can signal the rhythm centre to make necessary adjustments in the respiratory process by which these substances can be eliminated. Receptors associated with aortic arch and carotid artery also can recognise changes in CO2 and H’“ concentration and send necessary signals to the rhythm centre for remedial actions. The role of oxygen in the regulation of respiratory rhythm is quite insigniﬁcant. 17.6 DISORDERS 0F RESPIRATORY SYSTEM Asthma is a difﬁculty in breathing causing wheezing due to inﬂammation of bronchi and bronchioles. Emphysema is a chronic disorder in which alveolar walls are damaged due to which respiratory surface is decreased. One of the major causes of this is cigarette smoking."

But how to deal with the problem of determination of area of an irregular figure? The mathematical notion of integral is necessary in connection with such problems. Let us take a concrete example. Suppose a variable force f (x) acts on a particle in its motion along x - axis from x = a to x = b. The problem is to determine the work done (W) by the force on the particle during the motion. This problem is discussed in detail in Chapter 6. Figure 3.3 1 shows the variation of ﬁx) with x. If the force were constant, work would be simply the area F(b-a) as shown in Fig. 3.3l(i).

physics/,"WAV ES 379 If on the other hand, the boundary point is not rigid but completely free to move (such as in the case of a string tied to a freely moving ring on a rod), the reﬂected pulse has the same phase and amplitude (assuming no energy dissipation) as the incident pulse. The net maximum displacement at the boundary is then twice the amplitude of each pulse. An example of non- rigid boundary is the open end of an organ pipe. To summarise, a travelling wave or pulse suffers a phase change of 7c on reﬂection at a rigid boundary and no phase change on reﬂection at an open boundary. To put this mathematically, let the incident travelling wave be y2(x,t) = asin(kx—a)t) At a rigid boundary, the reﬂected wave is given by yr(x, t) = a sin (kx— wt + 7:). = — asin (kx—wt) (15.35) At an open boundary, the reﬂected wave is given by yr(x, t) = a sin (kx— wt + O). = asin (kx—wt) (15.36) Clearly, at the rigid boundary, y = y2 + yr 2 0 at all times. 15.6.1 Standing Waves and Normal Modes We considered above reﬂection at one boundary. But there are familiar situations (a string fixed at either end or an air column in a pipe with either end closed) in which reﬂection takes place at two or more boundaries. In a string, for example, a wave travelling in one direction will get reﬂected at one end, which in turn will travel and get reﬂected from the other end. This will go on until there is a steady wave pattern set up on the string. Such wave patterns are called standing waves or stationary waves. To see this mathematically, consider a wave travelling along the positive direction of x-axis and a reﬂected wave of the same amplitude and wavelength in the negative direction of x-axis. From Eqs. (15.2) and (15.4), with ¢= O, we get: y,(x, t) = asin (kx— wt) y2(x, t) = a sin (kx + cot) The resultant wave on the string is, according to the principle of superposition: y (x, t) = y1(x, t) + y2(x, t) = a [sin (kx— wt) + sin (kx + wt)] Using the familiar trignometric identity Sin (A+B) + Sin (A—B) = 2 sin A cosB we get, y (x, t) = 2a sin kxcos wt (15.37) Note the important difference in the wave pattern described by Eq. (15.37) from that described by Eq. (15.2) or Eq. (15.4). The terms kx and cut appear separately, not in the combination kx - cut. The amplitude of this wave is 2a sin kx. Thus, in this wave pattern, the amplitude varies from point-to-point, but each element of the string oscillates with the same angular frequency a) or time period. There is no phase difference between oscillations of different elements of the wave. The string as a whole vibrates in phase with differing amplitudes at different points. The wave pattern is neither moving to the right nor to the left. Hence, they are called standing or stationary waves. The amplitude is fixed at a given location but, as remarked earlier, it is different at different locations. The points at which the amplitude is zero (i.e., where there is no motion at all) are nodes; the points at which the amplitude is the largest are called antinodes. Fig. 15.12 shows a stationary wave pattern resulting from superposition of two travelling waves in opposite directions. The most significant feature of stationary waves is that the boundary conditions constrain the possible wavelengths or frequencies of vibration of the system. The system cannot oscillate with any arbitrary frequency (contrast this with a harmonic travelling wave), but is characterised by a set of natural frequencies or normal modes of oscillation. Let us determine these normal modes for a stretched string fixed at both ends. First, from Eq. (15.37), the positions of nodes (where the amplitude is zero) are given by sin kx = O . which implies kx= mt; n=0, 1, 2, 3, Since, k = 27r//’L , we get m1 x=?;n=0, 1,2,3,...

biology/,"MORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 5.5. 1 .3 Androecium Androecium is composed of stamens. Each stamen which represents the male reproductive organ consists of a stalk or a filament and an anther. Each anther is usually bilobed and each lobe has two chambers, the pollen-sacs. The pollen grains are produced in pollen-sacs. A sterile stamen is called staminode. Stamens of ﬂower may be united with other members such as petals or among themselves. When stamens are attached to the petals, they are epipetalous as in brinjal, or epiphyllous when attached to the perianth as in the ﬂowers of lily. The stamens in a ﬂower may either remain free (polyandrous) or may be united in varying degrees. The stamens may be united into one bunch or one bundle (monoadelphous) as in china rose, or two bundles (diadelphous) as in pea, or into more than two bundles (polyadelphous) as in citrus. There may be a variation in the length of filaments within a ﬂower, as in Salvia and mustard. 5.5. 1 .4 Gynoecium Gynoecium is the female reproductive part of the ﬂower and is made up of one or more carpels. A carpel consists of three parts namely stigma, style and ovary. Ovary is the enlarged basal part, on which lies the elongated tube, the style. The style connects the ovary to the stigma. The stigma is usually at the tip of the style and is the receptive surface for pollen grains. Each ovary bears one or more ovules attached to a ﬂattened, cushion-like placenta. When more than one carpel is present, they may be free (as in lotus and rose) and are called apocarpous. They are termed syncarpous when carpels are fused, as in mustard and tomato. After fertilisation, the ovules develop into seeds and the ovary matures into a fruit. Placentation: The arrangement of ovules within the ovary is known as placentation. The placentation are of different types namely, marginal, axile, parietal, basal, central and free central (Figure 5.16). In marginal placentation the placenta forms a ridge along the ventral suture of the ovary and the ovules are borne on this ridge forming two rows, as in pea. When the placenta is axial and the ovules are attached to it in a multilocular ovary, the placentaion is said to be axile, as in china rose, tomato and lemon. In parietal placentation, the ovules develop on the inner wall of the ovary or on peripheral part. Ovary is one-chambered but it becomes two- chambered due to the formation of the false septum, e.g., mustard and Argemone. When the ovules are borne on central axis and septa are absent, as in Dianthus and Primrose the placentation is 2019-2020 75 (b) (6) Figure 5.16 Types of placentation : (a) Marginal (b) Axile (c) Parietal (d) Free central (e) Basal"
biology/,"NEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 2 1.3.2 Transmission of Impulses A nerve impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another through junctions called synapses. A synapse is formed by the membranes of a pre-synaptic neuron and a post-synaptic neuron, which may or may not be separated by a gap called synaptic cleft. There are two types of synapses, namely, electrical synapses and chemical synapses. At electrical synapses, the membranes of pre- and post-synaptic neurons are in very close proximity. Electrical current can ﬂow directly from one neuron into the other across these synapses. Transmission of an impulse across electrical synapses is very similar to impulse conduction along a single axon. Impulse transmission across an electrical synapse is always faster than that across a chemical synapse. Electrical synapses are rare in our system. At a chemical synapse, the membranes of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons are separated by a ﬂuid-ﬁlled space called synaptic cleft (Figure 21.3). Do you know how the pre-synaptic neuron transmits an impulse (action potential) across the synaptic cleft to the post-synaptic neuron? Chemicals called neurotransmitters are involved in the transmission of impulses at these synapses. The axon terminals contain vesicles filled with these neurotransmitters. When an impulse (action potential) arrives at the axon terminal, it stimulates the movement of the synaptic vesicles towards the membrane where they fuse with the plasma Axon Axon Neurotransmitters Figure 21.3 Diagram showing axon terminal and synapse 201 9-2020 terminal Synaptic vesicles Pre—synaptic membrane Synaptic cleft Post-synaptic membrane Receptors asdeuﬁs 319"

The vegetative cells have a cellulosic wall usually covered on the outside by a gelatinous coating of algin. The protoplast contains, in addition to plastids, a centrally located vacuole and nucleus. The plant body is usually attached to the substratum by a holdfast, and has a stalk, the stipe and leaf like photosynthetic organ — the frond. Vegetative reproduction takes place by fragmentation. Asexual reproduction in most brown algae is by biﬂagellate zoospores that are pear-shaped and have two unequal laterally attached ﬂagella. Sexual reproduction may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous. Union of gametes may take place in water or within the oogonium (oogamous species). The gametes are pyriform (pear-shaped) and bear two laterally attached ﬂagella. The common forms are Ectocarpus, Dictyota, Laminaria, Sargassum and Fucus (Figure 3.1b). 3. 1 .3 Rhodophyceae The members of rhodophyceae are commonly called red algae because of the predominance of the red pigment, r-phycoerythrin in their body. Majority of the red algae are marine with greater concentrations found in the warmer areas. They occur in both well-lighted regions close to the surface of water and also at great depths in oceans where relatively little light penetrates. The red thalli of most of the red algae are multicellular. Some of them have complex body organisation. The food is stored as ﬂoridean starch which is very similar to amylopectin and glycogen in structure. The red algae usually reproduce vegetatively by fragmentation.

The phrase ‘calculate the work done' is incomplete. We should refer [or imply clearly by context) to the work done by a speciﬁc force or a group of forces on a given body over a certain displacement. Work done is a scalar quantity. It can be positive or negative unlike mass and kinetic energy which are positive scalar quantities. The work done by the friction or viscous force on a moving body is negative. For two bodies. the sum of the mutual forces exerted between them is zero from Newton‘s Third Law. F + F = 0 12 21 But the sum of the work done by the two forces need not always cancel. Le. W12+ W21¢ 0 However. it may sometimes be true. The work done by a force can be calculated sometimes even if the exact nature of the force is not known. This is clear from Example 6.2 where the WE theorem is used in such a situation. The WE theorem is not independent of Newton's Second Law. The WE theorem may be viewed as a scalar form of the Second Law. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy may be viewed as a consequence of the WE theorem for conservative forces. The WE theorem holds in all inertial frames. It can also be extended to non— inertial frames provided we include the pseudoforces in the calculation of the net force acting on the body under consideration. The potential energy of a body subjected to a conservative force is always undetermined upto a constant. For example. the point where the potential energy is zero is a matter of choice. For the gravitational potential energy mgh, the zero of the potential energy is chosen to be the ground. For the spring potential energy 1063/2 . the zero of the potential energy is the equilibrium position of the oscillating mass. Every force encountered in mechanics does not have an associated potential energy. For example. work done by friction over a closed path is not zero and no potential energy can be associated with friction. During a collision : (a) the total linear momentum is conserved at each instant of the collision ; (b) the kinetic energy conservation [even if the collision is elastic) applies after the collision is over and does not hold at every instant of the collision. In fact the two colliding objects are deformed and may be momentarily at rest with respect to each other. 2019-20 133"

physics/,"68 PHYSICS arranged head to tail, this graphical method is called the head-to-tail method. The two vectors and their resultant form three sides of a triangle, so this method is also known as triangle method of vector addition. If we find the resultant of B + A as in Fig. 4.4(c), the same vector R is obtained. Thus, vector addition is commutative: A+B=B+A (4.1) The addition of vectors also obeys the associative law as illustrated in Fig. 4.4(d). The result of adding vectors A and B first and then adding vector C is the same as the result of adding B and C first and then adding vector A : (A+B)+C=A+(B+C) (4.2) What is the result of adding two equal and opposite vectors ? Consider two vectors A and —A shown in Fig. 4.3(b). Their sum is A + (—A). Since the magnitudes of the two vectors are the same, but the directions are opposite, the resultant vector has zero magnitude and is represented by 0 called a null vector or a zero vector : A—A=0 |0|=O (4.3) Since the magnitude of a null vector is zero, its direction cannot be specified. The null vector also results when we multiply a vector A by the number zero. The main properties of 0 are : A+0=A 7&0=0 OA=0 (4.4) (a) What is the physical meaning of a zero vector? Consider the position and displacement vectors in a plane as shown in Fig. 4. 1(a). Now suppose that an object which is at P at time t, moves to P’ and then comes back to P. Then, what is its displacement? Since the initial and final positions coincide, the displacement is a “null vector”. Subtraction of vectors can be defined in terms of addition of vectors. We define the difference of two vectors A and B as the sum of two vectors A and —B : A— B = A + (—B) (4.5) It is shown in Fig 4.5. The vector —B is added to vectorA to get R2 = (A — B). The vector R1= A + B is also shown in the same figure for comparison. We can also use the parallelogram method to find the sum of two vectors. Suppose we have two vectors A and B. To add these vectors, we bring their tails to a common origin 0 as shown in Fig. 4.6(a). Then we draw a line from the head of A parallel to B and another line from the head of B parallel to A to complete a parallelogram OQSP. Now we join the point of the intersection of these two lines to the origin 0. The resultant vector R is directed from the common origin 0 along the diagonal (OS) of the parallelogram [Fig. 4.6(b)]. In Fig.4.6(c), the triangle law is used to obtain the resultant of A and B and we see that the two methods yield the same result. Thus, the two methods are equivalent.

physics/,"UNITS AND MEASUREMENT 31 For example, 12.9 g — 7.06 g, both speciﬁed to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures, cannot properly be evaluated as 5.84 g but only as 5.8 g, as uncertainties in subtraction or addition combine in a different fashion (smallest number of decimal places rather than the number of significant figures in any of the number added or subtracted). (3) The relative error of a value of number speciﬁed to signiﬁcant ﬁgures depends not only on 11 but also on the number itself. For example, the accuracy in measurement of mass 1.02 g is i 0.0 1 g whereas another measurement 9.89 g is also accurate to i 0.01 g. The relative error in 1.02 g is = (i 0.01/1.02) x 100 % = i 1% Similarly, the relative error in 9.89 g is = (i 0.01/9.89) x 100 % = i 0.1 % Finally, remember that intermediate results in a multi-step computation should be calculated to one more signiﬁcant ﬁgure in every measurement than the number of digits in the least precise measurement. These should be justified by the data and then the arithmetic operations may be carried out; otherwise rounding errors can build up. For example, the reciprocal of 9.58, calculated (after rounding off) to the same number of signiﬁcant figures (three) is 0.104, but the reciprocal of 0.104 calculated to three significant figures is 9.62. However, if we had written 1 / 9.58 = 0.1044 and then taken the reciprocal to three significant figures, we would have retrieved the original value of 9.58. This example justifies the idea to retain one more extra digit (than the number of digits in the least precise measurement) in intermediate steps of the complex multi-step calculations in order to avoid additional errors in the process of rounding off the numbers. 2.8 DIMENSIONS OF PHYSICAL QUANTITIES The nature of a physical quantity is described by its dimensions. All the physical quantities represented by derived units can be expressed in terms of some combination of seven fundamental or base quantities. We shall call these base quantities as the seven dimensions of the physical world, which are denoted with square brackets [ ]. Thus, length has the dimension [L], mass [M], time [T], electric current [A], thermodynamic temperature [K], luminous intensity [cd], and amount of substance [mol]. The dimensions of a physical quantity are the powers (or exponents) to which the base quantities are raised to represent that quantity. Note that using the square brackets [ ] round a quantity means that we are dealing with ‘the dimensions of’ the quantity. In mechanics, all the physical quantities can be written in terms of the dimensions [L], [M] and [T]. For example, the volume occupied by an object is expressed as the product of length, breadth and height, or three lengths. Hence the dimensions of volume are [L] X [L] X [L] = [L]3 = [L3]. As the volume is independent of mass and time, it is said to possess zero dimension in mass [M°], zero dimension in time [T°] and three dimensions in length. Similarly, force, as the product of mass and acceleration, can be expressed as Force = mass X acceleration = mass X (length)/(time)2 The dimensions of force are [M] [L] / [T]2 = [M L T2]. Thus, the force has one dimension in mass, one dimension in length, and —2 dimensions in time. The dimensions in all other base quantities are zero. Note that in this type of representation, the magnitudes are not considered. It is the quality of the type of the physical quantity that enters. Thus, a change in velocity, initial velocity, average velocity, ﬁnal velocity, and speed are all equivalent in this context. Since all these quantities can be expressed as length/time, their dimensions are [L]/ [T] or [L ""1“]. 2.9 DIMENSIONAL FORMULAE AND DIMENSIONAL EQUATIONS The expression which shows how and which of the base quantities represent the dimensions of a physical quantity is called the dimensional formula of the given physical quantity. For example, the dimensional formula of the volume is [M° L3 T°], and that of speed or velocity is [M° LT1]. Similarly, [M° L’I‘2] is the dimensional formula of acceleration and [M L‘3 T°] that of mass density. An equation obtained by equating a physical quantity with its dimensional formula is called the dimensional equation of the physical 2019-20"
biology/,"Ernst Mayr (1904 — 2004) Born on 5 July 1904, in Kempten, Germany, ERNST MAYR, the Harvard University evolutionary biologist who has been called ‘The Darwin of the 20th century’, was one of the 100 greatest scientists of all time. Mayr joined Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences in 1953 and retired in 1975, assuming the title Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology Emeritus. Throughout his nearly 80-year career, his research spanned ornithology, taxonomy, zoogeography, evolution, systematics, and the history and philosophy of biology. He almost single-handedly made the origin of species diversity the central question of evolutionary biology that it is today. He also pioneered the currently accepted definition of a biological species. Mayr was awarded the three prizes widely regarded as the triple crown of biology: the Balzan Prize in 1983, the International Prize for Biology in 1994, and the Crafoord Prize in 1999.

Ligases: Enzymes catalysing the linking together of 2 compounds, e. g., enzymes which catalyse joining of C-0, C-S, C-N, P-O etc. bonds. 9. 12.6 Co-factors Enzymes are composed of one or several polypeptide chains. However, there are a number of cases in which non-protein constituents called co- factors are bound to the the enzyme to make the enzyme catalytically active. In these instances, the protein portion of the enzymes is called the apoenzyme. Three kinds of cofactors may be identiﬁed: prosthetic groups, co-enzymes and metal ions. Prosthetic groups are organic compounds and are distinguished from other cofactors in that they are tightly bound to the apoenzyme. For example, in peroxidase and catalase, which catalyze the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, haem is the prosthetic group and it is a part of the active site of the enzyme. Co-enzymes are also organic compounds but their association with the apoenzyme is only transient, usually occurring during the course of catalysis. Furthermore, co-enzymes serve as co-factors in a number of different enzyme catalyzed reactions. The essential chemical components of many coenzymes are vitamins, e. g., coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and NADP contain the vitamin niacin. A number of enzymes require metal ions for their activity which form coordination bonds with side chains at the active site and at the same time form one or more cordination bonds with the substrate, e. g., zinc is a cofactor for the proteolytic enzyme carboxypeptidase. Catalytic activity is lost when the co-factor is removed from the enzyme which testiﬁes that they play a crucial role in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. SUMMARY Although there is a bewildering diversity of living organisms, their chemical composition and metabolic reactions appear to be remarkably similar. The elemental composition of living tissues and non-living matter appear also to be similar when analysed qualitatively. However, a closer examination reveals that the relative abundance of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen is higher in living systems when compared to inanimate matter.

(A particle is ideally represented as a point mass having no size.) We applied the results of our study even to the motion of bodies of finite size, assuming that motion of such bodies can be described in terms of the motion of a particle. Any real body which we encounter in daily life has a finite size. In dealing with the motion of extended bodies (bodies of finite size) often the idealised model of a particle is inadequate. In this chapter we shall try to go beyond this inadequacy. We shall attempt to build an understanding of the motion of extended bodies. An extended body, in the first place, is a system of particles. We shall begin with the consideration of motion of the system as a whole. The centre of mass of a system of particles will be a key concept here. We shall discuss the motion of the centre of mass of a system of particles and usefulness of this concept in understanding the motion of extended bodies. A large class of problems with extended bodies can be solved by considering them to be rigid bodies. Ideally a rigid body is a body with a perfectly definite and unchanging shape. The distances between all pairs of particles of such a body do not change. It is evident from this definition of a rigid body that no real body is truly rigid, since real bodies deform under the inﬂuence of forces. But in many situations the deformations are negligible. In a number of situations involving bodies such as wheels, tops, steel beams, molecules and planets on the other hand, we can ignore that they warp (twist out of shape), bend or vibrate and treat them as rigid. 7.1.1 What kind of motion can a rigid body have? Let us try to explore this question by taking some examples of the motion of rigid bodies. Let us begin with a rectangular 2019-20"
biology/,"BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 19 Though the bacterial structure is very simple, they are very complex in behaviour. Compared to many other organisms, bacteria as a group show the most extensive metabolic diversity. Some of the bacteria are autotrophic, i.e., they synthesise their own food from inorganic substrates. They may be photosynthetic autotrophic or chemosynthetic autotrophic. The vast majority of bacteria are heterotrophs, i.e., they depend on other organisms or on dead organic matter for food. 2. 1 . 1 Archaebacteria ’Ihese bacteria are special since they live in some of the most harsh habitats such as extreme salty areas (halophiles), hot springs (thermoacidophiles) and marshy areas (methanogens). Archaebacteria differ from other bacteria in having a different cell wall structure and this feature is responsible for their survival in extreme conditions. Methanogens are present in the gut of several ruminant animals such as cows and buffaloes and they are responsible for the production of methane (biogas) from the dung of these animals. 2. 1 .2 Eubacteria There are thousands of different eubacteria or ‘true bacteria’. They are characterised by the presence of a rigid cell wall, and if motile, a ﬂagellum. The cyanobacteria (also referred to as blue- green algae) have chlorophyll a similar to green plants and are photosynthetic autotrophs (Figure 2.2). The cyanobacteria are unicellular, colonial or ﬁlamentous, freshwater / marine or terrestrial algae. The colonies are generally surrounded by gelatinous sheath. They often form blooms in polluted water bodies. Some of these organisms can fix atmospheric nitrogen in specialised cells called heterocysts, e. g., Nostoc and Anabaena. Chemosynthetic autotrophic bacteria oxidise various inorganic substances such as nitrates, nitrites and ammonia and use the released energy for their ATP production. They play a great role in recycling nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous, iron and sulphur. Heterotrophic bacteria are most abundant in nature. The majority are important decomposers. Many of them have a signiﬁcant impact on human affairs. They are helpful in making curd from milk, production of antibiotics, ﬁxing nitrogen in legume Figure 2.2 A ﬁlamentous blue-green algae — Nostoc"
biology/,"224 BIOLOGY SUMMARY Green plants make their own food by photosynthesis. During this process carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is taken in by leaves through stomata and used for making carbohydrates, principally glucose and starch. Photosynthesis takes place only in the green parts of the plants, mainly the leaves. Within the leaves, the mesophyll cells have a large number of chloroplasts that are responsible for CO2 ﬁxation. Within the chloroplasts, the membranes are sites for the light reaction, while the chemosynthetic pathway occurs in the stroma. Photosynthesis has two stages: the light reaction and the carbon ﬁxing reactions. In the light reaction the light energy is absorbed by the pigments present in the antenna, and funnelled to special chlorophyll a molecules called reaction centre chlorophylls. There are two photosystems, PS I and PS II. PS I has a 700 nm absorbing chlorophyll a P700 molecule at its reaction centre, while PS II has a P680 reaction cemtge that absorbs red light at 680 nm. After absorbing light, eyctrons are exciteyl and transferred through PS II and PS I and ﬁnally to NADéféi‘ming NADH. <{Dumvfgg’thls process a proton gradient 1s created across the mg”? anle the thy yl\ dr‘The breakdown of the protons gradient due to movemynt : ough thegF 04pm; oﬁthe A’IPase enzyme releases enough energy for synth‘gs of ‘ETP Sp aﬁigg %f water molecules is associated with PS II resulting mﬁleﬁ r gage of 02, pgétﬁns and transfer of electrons to PS II. 3Q g?

accounts/,"Trial Balance and Rectification of Errors 199 The trial balance when prepared on the basis of above balances will not tally. Its credit column total will amount to f 50,000 and debit column total to f 35,000. The trial balance would differ with ? 15,000. This difference will be temporarily put to suspense account and trial balance will be made to agree in the ledger. In the above case, difference in trial balance has arisen due to one sided error (omission of posting to Diwakar and sons’s account). In a real situation, there can be many other such one-sided errors which cause a difference in trial balance and thus result in opening of the suspense account. Till the all errors affecting agreement of trial balance are not located it is not possible to rectify them and tally the trial balance in such a situation, is shown in the Suspense account, make the total of debit and credit columns and proceed further with the accounting process. When the errors are located and the specific accounts and amounts involved are identified, the amounts are transferred from suspense account to the relevant accounts thereby closing the suspense account. Thus, suspense account is not placed in any particular category of accounts and is just a temporary phenomenon. While rectifying one-sided errors using suspense account, the following steps are taken: (i) Identify the account affected due to error. (ii) Ascertain the amount of excess debit / credit or short debit / credit in the affected account. (iii) If the error has resulted in excess debit or short credit in the affected account, credit the account with the amount of excess debit or short credit. (iv) If the error has resulted in excess credit or short debit in the affected account, debit the account with the amount of excess credit or short debit. (v) Complete the journal entry by debiting or crediting the suspense account as another account affected otherwise. We will now discuss the process of rectiﬁcation using suspense account: (a) Credit sales to Mohan 3 10,000 were not posted to his account.

biology/,"Melvin Calvin MELVIN CALVIN born in Minnesota in April, 191 1, received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Minnesota. He served as Professor of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. Just after world war II, when the world was under shock after the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings, and seeing the ill- effects of radio-activity, Calvin and co-workers put radio- activity to beneficial use. He along with J .A. Bassham studied reactions in green plants forming sugar and other substances from raw materials like carbon dioxide, water and minerals by labelling the carbon dioxide with C14. Calvin proposed that plants change light energy to chemical energy by transferring an electron in an organised array of pigment molecules and other substances. The mapping of the pathway of carbon assimilation in photosynthesis earned him Nobel Prize in 196 1. The principles of photosynthesis as established by Calvin are, at present, being used in studies on renewable resource for energy and materials and basic studies in solar energy research. 201 9-2020"

We shall now describe this law of addition using the graphical method. Let us consider two vectors A and B that lie in a plane as shown in Fig. 4.4(a). The lengths of the line segments representing these vectors are proportional to the magnitude of the vectors. To find the sum A + B, we place vector B so that its tail is at the head of the vector A, as in Fig. 4.4(b). Then, we join the tail of A to the head of B.

physics/,"238 PHYSICS is known as hydraulic stress and in magnitude is equal to the hydraulic pressure (applied force per unit area). The strain produced by a hydraulic pressure is called volume strain and is defined as the ratio of change in volume (AV) to the original volume (V). A_V V Since the strain is a ratio of change in dimension to the original dimension, it has no units or dimensional formula. Volume strain = (9.5) 9.4 HOOKE'S LAW Stress and strain take different forms in the situations depicted in the Fig. (9.2). For small deformations the stress and strain are proportional to each other. This is known as Hooke’s law. Thus, stress o< strain stress = k x strain (9.6) where k is the proportionality constant and is known as modulus of elasticity. Hooke’s law is an empirical law and is found to be valid for most materials. However, there are some materials which do not exhibit this linear relationship. 9.5 STRESS-STRAIN CURVE The relation between the stress and the strain for a given material under tensile stress can be found experimentally. In a standard test of tensile properties, a test cylinder or a wire is stretched by an applied force. The fractional change in length (the strain) and the applied force needed to cause the strain are recorded. The applied force is gradually increased in steps and the change in length is noted. A graph is plotted between the stress (which is equal in magnitude to the applied force per unit area) and the strain produced. A typical graph for a metal is shown in Fig. 9.3. Analogous graphs for compression and shear stress may also be obtained. The stress-strain curves vary from material to material. These curves help us to understand how a given material deforms with increasing loads. From the graph, we can see that in the region between 0 to A, the curve is linear. In this region, Hooke’s law is obeyed. 2019-20 The body regains its original dimensions when the applied force is removed. In this region, the solid behaves as an elastic body. Fracture B I point A I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I A[fl/Permanent set . 30% <1% Straln —> Fig. 9.3 A typical stress—strain curve for a metal. In the region from A to B, stress and strain are not proportional. Nevertheless, the body still returns to its original dimension when the load is removed. The point B in the curve is known as yield point (also known as elastic limit) and the corresponding stress is known as yield strength (0y) of the material. If the load is increased further, the stress developed exceeds the yield strength and strain increases rapidly even for a small change in the stress. The portion of the curve between B and D shows this. When the load is removed, say at some point C between B and D, the body does not regain its original dimension. In this case, even when the stress is zero, the strain is not zero. The material is said to have a permanent set. The deformation is said to be plastic deformation. The point D on the graph is the ultimate tensile strength (on) of the material. Beyond this point, additional strain is produced even by a reduced applied force and fracture occurs at point E. If the ultimate strength and fracture points D and E are close, the material is said to be brittle. If they are far apart, the material is said to be ductile. As stated earlier, the stress-strain behaviour varies from material to material. For example, rubber can be pulled to several times its original length and still returns to its original shape.

During the formation of leaves and elongation of stem, some cells ‘left behind’ from shoot apical meristem, constitute the axillary bud. Such buds are present in the axils of leaves and are capable of forming a branch or a ﬂower. The meristem which occurs between mature tissues is known as intercalary meristem. They occur in grasses and regenerate parts removed by the grazing herbivores. Both apical meristems and intercalary meristems are primary meristems because they appear early in life of a plant and contribute to the formation of the primary plant body. The meristem that occurs in the mature regions of roots and shoots of many plants, particularly those that produce woody axis and appear later than primary meristem is called the secondary or lateral meristem. They are cylindrical meristems. Fascicular vascular cambium, interfascicular cambium and cork-cambium are examples of lateral meristems. These are responsible for producing the secondary tissues. Following divisions of cells in both primary and as well as secondary meristems, the newly formed cells become structurally and functionally specialised and lose the ability to divide. Such cells are termed permanent or mature cells and constitute the permanent tissues. During the formation of the primary plant body, speciﬁc regions of the apical meristem produce dermal tissues, ground tissues and vascular tissues.

biology/,"PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT Similarly, there are a number of events in the life of a plant where more than one PGR interact to affect that event, e. g., dormancy in seeds / buds, abscission, senescence, apical dominance, etc. Remember, the role of PGR is of only one kind of intrinsic control. Along with genomic control and extrinsic factors, they play an important role in plant growth and development. Many of the extrinsic factors such as temperature and light, control plant growth and development via PGR. Some of such events could be: vernalisation, ﬂowering, dormancy, seed germination, plant movements, etc. We shall discuss brieﬂy the role of light and temperature (both of them, the extrinsic factors) on initiation of ﬂowering. 15.5 PHOTOPERIODISM It has been observed that some plants require a periodic exposure to light to induce ﬂowering. It is also seen that such plants are able to measure the duration of exposure to light. For example, some plants require the exposure to light for a period exceeding a well deﬁned critical duration, while others must be exposed to light for a period less than this critical duration before the ﬂowering is initiated in them. The former group of plants are called long day plants while the latter ones are termed short day plants. The critical duration is different for different plants. There are many plants, however, where there is no such correlation between exposure to light duration and induction of ﬂowering response; such plants are called day-neutral plants (Figure 15.12).

The chief sinks for the mineral elements are the growing regions of the plant, such as the apical and lateral meristems, young leaves, developing ﬂowers, fruits and seeds, and the storage organs. Unloading of mineral ions occurs at the ﬁne vein endings through diffusion and active uptake by these cells. Mineral ions are frequently remobilised, particularly from older, senescing parts. Older dying leaves export much of their mineral content to younger leaves. Similarly, before leaf fall in decidous plants, minerals are removed to other parts. Elements most readily mobilised are phosphorus, sulphur, nitrogen and potassium. Some elements that are structural components like calcium are not remobilised. An analysis of the xylem exudates shows that though some of the nitrogen travels as inorganic ions, much of it is carried in the organic form as amino acids and related compounds. Similarly, small amounts of P and S are carried as organic compounds. In addition, small amount of exchange of materials does take place between xylem and phloem. Hence, it is not that we can clearly make a distinction and say categorically that xylem transports only inorganic nutrients while phloem transports only organic materials, as was traditionally believed.

Usually the source is understood to be that part of the plant which synthesises the food, i.e., the leaf, and sink, the part that needs or stores the food. But, the source and sink may be reversed depending on the season, or the plant’s needs. Sugar stored in roots may be mobilised to become a source of food in the early spring when the buds of trees, act as sink; they need energy for growth and development of the photosynthetic apparatus. Since the source-sink relationship is variable, the direction of movement in the phloem can be upwards or downwards, i.e., bi-directional. This contrasts with that of the xylem where the movement is always unidirectional, i.e., upwards. Hence, unlike one-way ﬂow of water in transpiration, food in phloem sap can be transported in any required direction so long as there is a source of sugar and a sink able to use, store or remove the sugar. Phloem sap is mainly water and sucrose, but other sugars, hormones and amino acids are also transported or translocated through phloem."

We saw that uniform motion needs the concept of velocity alone whereas non-uniform motion requires the concept of acceleration in addition. So far, we have not asked the question as to what governs the motion of bodies. In this chapter, we turn to this basic question. Let us first guess the answer based on our common experience. To move a football at rest, someone must kick it. To throw a stone upwards, one has to give it an upward push. A breeze causes the branches of a tree to swing; a strong wind can even move heavy objects. A boat moves in a ﬂowing river without anyone rowing it. Clearly, some external agency is needed to provide force to move a body from rest. Likewise, an external force is needed also to retard or stop motion. You can stop a ball rolling down an inclined plane by applying a force against the direction of its motion. In these examples, the external agency of force (hands, wind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object. This is not always necessary. A stone released from the top of a building accelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the earth. A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance. This shows that external agencies (e.g. gravitational and magnetic forces) can exert force on a body even from a distance. In short, a force is required to put a stationary body in motion or stop a moving body, and some external agency is needed to provide this force. The external agency may or may not be in contact with the body. So far so good. But what if a body is moving uniformly (e.g. a skater moving straight with constant speed on a horizontal ice slab) ? Is an external force required to keep a body in uniform motion? 2019-20"
physics/,"30 PHYSICS insignificant digit to be dropped (the underlined digit in this case) is more than 5, and is left unchanged if the latter is less than 5. But what if the number is 2.745 in which the insignificant digit is 5. Here, the convention is that if the preceding digit is even, the insignificant digit is simply dropped and, if it is odd, the preceding digit is raised by 1. Then, the number 2.74§ rounded off to three significant figures becomes 2.74. On the other hand, the number 2.73_5_ rounded off to three significant ﬁgures becomes 2.74 since the preceding digit is odd. In any involved or complex multi-step calculation, you should retain, in intermediate steps, one digit more than the significant digits and round off to proper significant figures at the end of the calculation. Similarly, a number known to be within many significant figures, such as in 2.99792458 x 108 m/s for the speed of light in vacuum, is rounded off to an approximate value 3 x 108 m/s , which is often employed in computations. Finally, remember that exact numbers that appear in formulae like ’L 2 7c in T = 27: —, have a large (infinite) number 9 of significant figures. The value of 7t = 3.1415926... is known to a large number of significant figures. You may take the value as 3.142 or 3.14 for 7c, with limited number of significant figures as required in specific cases. Example 2.13 Each side of a cube is measured to be 7.203 m. What are the total surface area and the volume of the cube to appropriate significant ﬁgures? Answer The number of significant figures in the measured length is 4.

You may wonder how a single cell then goes on to form such large organisms. Growth and reproduction are characteristics of cells, indeed of all living organisms. All cells reproduce by dividing into two, with each parental cell giving rise to two daughter cells each time they divide. These newly formed daughter cells can themselves grow and divide, giving rise to a new cell population that is formed by the growth and division of a single parental cell and its progeny. In other words, such cycles of growth and division allow a single cell to form a structure consisting of millions of cells. 10. 1 CELL CYCLE Cell division is a very important process in all living organisms. During the division of a cell, DNA replication and cell growth also take place. All these processes, i.e., cell division, DNA replication, and cell growth, hence, have to take place in a coordinated way to ensure correct division and formation of progeny cells containing intact genomes. The sequence of events by which a cell duplicates its genome, synthesises the other constituents of the cell and eventually divides into two daughter cells is termed cell cycle. Although cell growth (in terms of cytoplasmic increase) is a continuous process, DNA synthesis occurs only during one speciﬁc stage in the cell cycle. The replicated chromosomes (DNA) are then distributed to daughter nuclei by a complex series of events during cell division. These events are themselves under genetic control. 2019-2020"

Earlier classiﬁcation systems included bacteria, blue green algae, fungi, mosses, ferns, gymnosperms and the angiosperms under ‘Plants’. The character that uniﬁed this whole kingdom was that all the organisms included had a cell wall in their cells. This placed together groups which widely differed in other characteristics. It brought together the prokaryotic bacteria and the blue green algae (cyanobacteria) with other groups which were eukaryotic. It also grouped together the unicellular organisms and the multicellular ones, say, for example, Chlamydomonas and Spirogyra were placed together under algae.

physics/,"374 PHYSICS in general) and elastic properties (Young’s modulus for linear media / shear modulus, bulk modulus) of the medium. The medium determines the speed; Eq. (15.12) then relates wavelength to frequency for the given speed. Of course, as remarked earlier, the medium can support both transverse and longitudinal waves, which will have different speeds in the same medium. Later in this chapter, we shall obtain specific expressions for the speed of mechanical waves in some media. 15.4.1 Speed of a Transverse Wave on Stretched String The speed of a mechanical wave is determined by the restoring force setup in the medium when it is disturbed and the inertial properties (mass density) of the medium. The speed is expected to be directly related to the former and inversely to the latter. For waves on a string, the restoring force is provided by the tension Tin the string. The inertial property will in this case be linear mass density p, which is mass m of the string divided by its length L. Using Newton’s Laws of Motion, an exact formula for the wave speed on a string can be derived, but this derivation is outside the scope of this book. We shall, therefore, use dimensional analysis. We already know that dimensional analysis alone can never yield the exact formula. The overall dimensionless constant is always left undetermined by dimensional analysis. The dimension of ,u is [ML—1] and that of T is like force, namely [MLT2]. We need to combine these dimensions to get the dimension of speed v [L’ILI]. Simple inspection shows that the quantity T/u has the relevant dimension [MLT—Z] [MEI] Thus if T and u are assumed to be the only relevant physical quantities, =[L2T-2] v =C E (15.13) y where C is the undetermined constant of dimensional analysis. In the exact formula, it turms out, C=l. The speed of transverse waves on a stretched string is given by v = 3 (15.14) )1 Note the important point that the speed v depends only on the properties of the medium T and ,u (T is a property of the stretched string arising due to an external force). It does not depend on wavelength or frequency of the wave itself. In higher studies, you will come across waves whose speed is not independent of frequency of the wave. Of the two parameters 2L and v the source of disturbance determines the frequency of the wave generated. Given the Propagation of a pulse on a rope You can easily see the motion of a pulse on a rope. You can also see its reﬂection from a rigid boundary and measure its velocity of travel. You will need a rope of diameter 1 to 3 cm, two hooks and some weights. You can perform this experiment in your classroom or laboratory. Take a long rope or thick string of diameter 1 to 3 cm. and tie it to hooks on opposite walls in a hall or laboratory. Let one end pass on a hook and hang some weight [about 1 to 5 kg) to it. The walls may be about 3 to 5 m apart. Take a stick or a rod and strike the rope hard at a point near one end. This creates a pulse on the rope which now travels on it. You can see it reaching the end and reﬂecting back from it. You can check the phase relation between the incident pulse and reﬂected pulse. You can easily watch two or three reﬂections before the pulse dies out. You can take a stopwatch and find the time for the pulse to travel the distance between the walls. and thus measure its velocity. Compare it with that obtained from Eq. [15.14]. This is also what happens with a thin metallic string of a musical instrument. The major difference is that the velocity on a string is fairly high because of low mass per unit length. as compared to that on a thick rope. The low velocity on a rope allows us to watch the motion and make measurements beautifully. 2019-20"

physics/,"I26 PHYSICS unlike the conservative force, Wm depends on the particular path i to f. 4 6. 10 VARIOUS FORMS OF ENERGY : THE LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY In the previous section we have discussed mechanical energy. We have seen that it can be classified into two distinct categories : one based on motion, namely kinetic energy; the other on configuration (position), namely potential energy. Energy comes in many a forms which transform into one another in ways which may not often be clear to us. 6. 10.1 Heat We have seen that the frictional force is not a conservative force. However, work is associated with the force of friction, Example 6.5. A block of mass m sliding on a rough horizontal surface with speed v0 comes to a halt over a distance x0. The work done by the force of kinetic friction f over x0 is —f x0. By the work-energy theorem mug/2 = fxo- If we confine our scope to mechanics, we would say that the kinetic energy of the block is ‘lost’ due to the frictional force. On examination of the block and the table we would detect a slight increase in their temperatures. The work done by friction is not ‘lost’, but is transferred as heat energy. This raises the internal energy of the block and the table. In winter, in order to feel warm, we generate heat by vigorously rubbing our palms together. We shall see later that the internal energy is associated with the ceaseless, often random, motion of molecules. A quantitative idea of the transfer of heat energy is obtained by noting that 1 kg of water releases about 42000 J of energy when it cools by10 °C. 6. 10.2 Chemical Energy One of the greatest technical achievements of humankind occurred when we discovered how to ignite and control fire. We learnt to rub two ﬂint stones together (mechanical energy), got them to heat up and to ignite a heap of dry leaves (chemical energy), which then provided sustained warmth. A matchstick ignites into a bright ﬂame when struck against a specially prepared chemical surface. The lighted matchstick, when applied to a firecracker, results in a spectacular display of sound and light. 2019-20 Chemical energy arises from the fact that the molecules participating in the chemical reaction have different binding energies. A stable chemical compound has less energy than the separated parts. A chemical reaction is basically a rearrangement of atoms. Ifthe total energy of the reactants is more than the products of the reaction, heat is released and the reaction is said to be an exothermic reaction. Ifthe reverse is true, heat is absorbed and the reaction is endothermic. Coal consists of carbon and a kilogram of it when burnt releases about 3 x 107 J of energy. Chemical energy is associated with the forces that give rise to the stability of substances. These forces bind atoms into molecules, molecules into polymeric chains, etc. The chemical energy arising from the combustion of coal, cooking gas, wood and petroleum is indispensable to our daily existence. 6. 10.3 Electrical Energy The ﬂow of electrical current causes bulbs to glow, fans to rotate and bells to ring. There are laws governing the attraction and repulsion of charges and currents, which we shall learn later. Energy is associated with an electric current. An urban Indian household consumes about 200 J of energy per second on an average. 6. 10.4 The Equivalence of Mass and Energy Till the end of the nineteenth century, physicists believed that in every physical and chemical process, the mass of an isolated system is conserved. Matter might change its phase, e.g. glacial ice could melt into a gushing stream, but matter is neither created nor destroyed; Albert Einstein (1 879- 1955) however, showed that mass and energy are equivalent and are related by the relation E = m 02 (6.20) where c, the speed of light in vacuum is approximately 3 ><108 m s4. Thus, a staggering amount of energy is associated with a mere kilogram of matter E = 1x (3 X108)2 J = 9 ><1016 J. This is equivalent to the annual electrical output of a large (3000 MW) power generating station. 6. 10.5 Nuclear Energy The most destructive weapons made by man, the fission and fusion bombs are manifestations of"

The body cavity, which is lined by mesoderm is called coelom. Animals possessing coelom are called coelomates, e. g., annelids, molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates (Figure 4.3a). In some animals, the body cavity is not lined by mesoderm, instead, the mesoderm is present as scattered pouches in between the ectoderm and endoderm. Such a body cavity is called pseudocoelom and the animals possessing them are called pseudocoelomates, e.g., aschehninthes (Figure 4.3b).

They also help in respiration, secretion processes, to increase the surface area of the plasma membrane and enzymatic content. In some prokaryotes like cyanobacteria, there are other membranous extensions into the cytoplasm called chromatophores which contain pigments. Bacterial cells may be motile or non-motile. If motile, they have thin ﬁlamentous extensions from their cell wall called ﬂagella. Bacteria show a range in the number and arrangement of ﬂagella. Bacterial ﬂagellum is composed of three parts — ﬁlament, hook and basal body. The ﬁlament is the longest portion and extends from the cell surface to the outside. Besides ﬂagella, Pili and Fimbriae are also surface structures of the bacteria but do not play a role in motility. The pili are elongated tubular structures made of a special protein. The fimbriae are small bristle like fibres sprouting out of the cell. In some bacteria, they are known to help attach the bacteria to rocks in streams and also to the host tissues. 8.4.2 Ribosomes and Inclusion Bodies In prokaryotes, ribosomes are associated with the plasma membrane of the cell. They are about 15 nm by 20 nm in size and are made of two subunits - 508 and SOS units which when present together form 708 prokaryotic ribosomes. Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may attach to a single mRNA and form a chain called polyribosomes or polysome. The ribosomes of a polysome translate the mRNA into proteins. Inclusion bodies: Reserve material in prokaryotic cells are stored in the cytoplasm in the form of inclusion bodies. These are not bound by any membrane system and lie free in the cytoplasm, e.g., phosphate granules, cyanophycean granules and glycogen granules. Gas vacuoles are found in blue green and purple and green photosynthetic bacteria. 8.5 EUKARYOTIC CELLS The eukaryotes include all the protists, plants, animals and fungi. In eukaryotic cells there is an extensive compartmentalisation of cytoplasm through the presence of membrane bound organelles. Eukaryotic cells possess an organised nucleus with a nuclear envelope. In addition, eukaryotic cells have a variety of complex locomotory and cytoskeletal structures. Their genetic material is organised into chromosomes. All eukaryotic cells are not identical. Plant and animal cells are different as the former possess cell walls, plastids and a large central vacuole which are absent in animal cells. On the other hand, animal cells have centrioles which are absent in almost all plant cells (Figure 8.3). 129"

Hence, this molecule removes a proton from the stroma while transporting an electron. When this molecule passes on its electron to the electron carrier on the inner side of the membrane, the proton is released into the inner side or the lumen side of the membrane.

Similarly, if we were to study the internal structure, one also finds several similarities as well as differences. This chapter introduces you to the internal structure and functional organisation of higher plants. Study of internal structure of plants is called anatomy. Plants have cells as the basic unit, cells are organised into tissues and in turn the tissues are organised into organs. Different organs in a plant show differences in their internal structure. Within angiosperms, the monocots and dicots are also seen to be anatomically different. Internal structures also show adaptations to diverse environments. 6. 1 THE TISSUES A tissue is a group of cells having a common origin and usually performing a common function. A plant is made up of different kinds of tissues. Tissues are classiﬁed into two main groups, namely, meristematic and permanent tissues based on whether the cells being formed are capable of dividing or not. 6. 1 . 1 Meristematic Tissues Growth in plants is largely restricted to specialised regions of active cell division called meristems (Gk. meristos: divided). Plants have different kinds of meristems. The meristems which occur at the tips of roots and shoots and produce primary tissues are called apical meristems (Figure 6.1). 2019-2020"
biology/,"324 BIOLOGY itself continues forward to form a pigmented and opaque structure called the iris which is the visible coloured portion of the eye. The eye ball contains a transparent crystalline lens which is held in place by ligaments attached to the ciliary body. In front of the lens, the aperture surrounded by the iris is called the pupil. The diameter of the pupil is regulated by the muscle ﬁbres of iris. The inner layer is the retina and it contains three layers of neural cells — from inside to outside — ganglion cells, bipolar cells and photoreceptor cells. There are two types of photoreceptor cells, namely, rods and cones. These cells contain the light-sensitive proteins called the photopigments. The daylight (photopic) vision and colour vision are functions of cones and the twilight (scotopic) vision is the function of the rods. The rods contain a purplish-red protein called the rhodopsin or visual purple, which contains a derivative of Vitamin A. In the human eye, there are three types of cones which possess their own characteristic photopigments that respond to red, green and blue lights. The sensations of different colours are produced by various combinations of these cones and their photopigments. When these cones are stimulated equally, a sensation of white light is produced. The optic nerves leave the eye and the retinal blood vessels enter it at a point medial to and slightly above the posterior pole of the eye ball. Photoreceptor cells are not present in that region and hence it is called the blind spot. At the posterior pole of the eye lateral to the blind spot, there is a yellowish pigmented spot called macula lutea with a central pit called the fovea. The fovea is a thinned-out portion of the retina where only the cones are densely packed. It is the point where the visual acuity (resolution) is the greatest. The space between the cornea and the lens is called the aqueous chamber and contains a thin watery ﬂuid called aqueous humor. The space between the lens and the retina is called the vitreous chamber and is ﬁlled with a transparent gel called vitreous humor. 21 .6.1 .2 Mechanism of Vision The light rays in visible wavelength focussed on the retina through the cornea and lens generate potentials (impulses) in rods and cones. As mentioned earlier, the photosensitive compounds (photopigments) in the human eyes is composed of opsin (a protein) and retinal (an aldehyde of vitamin A). Light induces dissociation of the retinal from opsin resulting in changes in the structure of the opsin. This causes membrane permeability changes. As a result, potential differences are generated in the photoreceptor cells. This produces a signal that generates action potentials in the ganglion cells through the bipolar cells. These action potentials (impulses) are transmitted by the optic nerves to the visual"
biology/,"294 BIOLOGY The amount of the ﬁltrate formed by the kidneys per minute is called glomerular filtration rate (GFR). GFR in a healthy individual is approximately 125 ml/ minute, i.e., 180 litres per day ! The lddneys have built-in mechanisms for the regulation of glomerular ﬁltration rate. One such efﬁcient mechanism is carried out by juxta glomerular apparatus (J GA). J GA is a special sensitive region formed by cellular modiﬁcations in the distal convoluted tubule and the afferent arteriole at the location of their contact. A fall in GFR can activate the JG cells to release renin which can stimulate the glomerular blood ﬂow and thereby the GFR back to normal. A comparison of the volume of the ﬁltrate formed per day (1 80 litres per day) with that of the urine released (1.5 litres), suggest that nearly 99 per cent of the ﬁltrate has to be reabsorbed by the renal tubules. This process is called reabsorption. The tubular epithelial cells in different segments of nephron perform this either by active or passive mechanisms. For example, substances like glucose, amino acids, Na’“, etc., in the ﬁltrate are reabsorbed actively whereas the nitrogenous wastes are absorbed by passive transport. Reabsorption of water also occurs passively in the initial segments of the nephron (Figure 19.5). During urine formation, the tubular cells secrete substances like H’“, K+ and ammonia into the ﬁltrate. Tubular secretion is also an important step in urine formation as it helps in the maintenance of ionic and acid base balance of body ﬂuids. 19.3 FUNCTION or THE TUBULEs Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT): PCT is lined by simple cuboidal brush border epithelium which increases the surface area for reabsorption. Nearly all of the essential nutrients, and 70-80 per cent of electrolytes and water are reabsorbed by this segment. PCT also helps to maintain the pH and ionic balance of the body ﬂuids by selective secretion of hydrogen ions, ammonia and potassium ions into the ﬁltrate and by absorption of HCOS‘ from it. Henle’s Loop: Reabsorption is minimum in its ascending limb. However, this region plays a signiﬁcant role in the maintenance of high osmolarity of medullary interstitial ﬂuid. The descending limb of loop of Henle is permeable to water but almost impermeable to electrolytes. This concentrates the filtrate as it moves down. The ascending limb is impermeable to water but allows transport of electrolytes actively or passively. Therefore, as the concentrated ﬁltrate pass upward, it gets diluted due to the passage of electrolytes to the medullary ﬂuid. Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT): Conditional reabsorption of Na+ and water takes place in this segment. DCT is also capable of reabsorption of HCOs‘ and selective secretion of hydrogen and potassium ions and NH3 to maintain the pH and sodium-potassium balance in blood."
physics/,"90 PHYSICS 5.2 ARISTOTLE’S FALLACY The question posed above appears to be simple. However, it took ages to answer it. Indeed, the correct answer to this question given by Galileo in the seventeenth century was the foundation of Newtonian mechanics, which signalled the birth of modern science. The Greek thinker, Aristotle (384 B.C— 322 B.C.), held the view that if a body is moving, something external is required to keep it moving. According to this view, for example, an arrow shot from a bow keeps ﬂying since the air behind the arrow keeps pushing it. The view was part of an elaborate framework of ideas developed by Aristotle on the motion of bodies in the universe. Most of the Aristotelian ideas on motion are now known to be wrong and need not concern us. For our purpose here, the Aristotelian law of motion may be phrased thus: An external force is required to keep a body in motion. Aristotelian law of motion is ﬂawed, as we shall see. However, it is a natural view that anyone would hold from common experience. Even a small child playing with a simple (non-electric) toy-car on a ﬂoor knows intuitively that it needs to constantly drag the string attached to the toy- car with some force to keep it going. If it releases the string, it comes to rest. This experience is common to most terrestrial motion. External forces seem to be needed to keep bodies in motion. Left to themselves, all bodies eventually come to rest. What is the ﬂaw in Aristotle’s argument? The answer is: a moving toy car comes to rest because the external force of friction on the car by the ﬂoor opposes its motion. To counter this force, the child has to apply an external force on the car in the direction of motion. When the car is in uniform motion, there is no net external force acting on it: the force by the child cancels the force ( friction) by the ﬂoor. The corollary is: if there were no friction, the child would not be required to apply any force to keep the toy car in uniform motion. The opposing forces such as friction (solids) and viscous forces (for ﬂuids) are always present in the natural world. This explains why forces by external agencies are necessary to overcome the frictional forces to keep bodies in uniform motion. Now we understand where Aristotle went wrong. He coded this practical experience in the form of a basic argument. To get at the 2019-20 true law of nature for forces and motion, one has to imagine a world in which uniform motion is possible with no frictional forces opposing. This is what Galileo did. 5.3 THE LAW OF INERTIA Galileo studied motion of objects on an inclined plane. Objects (i) moving down an inclined plane accelerate, while those (ii) moving up retard. (iii) Motion on a horizontal plane is an intermediate situation. Galileo concluded that an object moving on a frictionless horizontal plane must neither have acceleration nor retardation, i.e. it should move with constant velocity (Fig. 5.1(a)). !__+.-. (i) (ii) (111} Fig. 5.1(a) Another experiment by Galileo leading to the same conclusion involves a double inclined plane. A ball released from rest on one of the planes rolls down and climbs up the other. If the planes are smooth, the ﬁnal height of the ball is nearly the same as the initial height (a little less but never greater). In the ideal situation, when friction is absent, the final height of the ball is the same as its initial height. If the slope of the second plane is decreased and the experiment repeated, the ball will still reach the same height, but in doing so, it will travel a longer distance. In the limiting case, when the slope of the second plane is zero (i.e. is a horizontal) the ball travels an infinite distance. In other words, its motion never ceases. This is, of course, an idealised situation (Fig. 5.1 (b)). Fig. 5.1(b) The law of inertia was inferred by Galileo from observations of motion of a ball on a double inclined plane."

biology/,"132 BIOLOGY An improved model of the structure of cell membrane was proposed by Singer and Nicolson (1972) widely accepted as ﬂuid mosaic model (Figure 8.4). According to this, the quasi-ﬂuid nature of lipid enables lateral movement of proteins within the overall bilayer. This ability to move within the membrane is measured as its ﬂuidity. The ﬂuid nature of the membrane is also important from the point of view of functions like cell growth, formation of intercellular junctions, secretion, endocytosis, cell division etc. One of the most important functions of the plasma membrane is the transport of the molecules across it. The membrane is selectively permeable to some molecules present on either side of it. Many molecules can move brieﬂy across the membrane without any requirement of energy and this is called the passive transport. Neutral solutes may move across the membrane by the process of simple diffusion along the concentration gradient, i.e., from higher concentration to the lower. Water may also move across this membrane from higher to lower concentration. Movement of water by diffusion is called osmosis. As the polar molecules cannot pass through the nonpolar lipid bilayer, they require a carrier protein of the membrane to facilitate their transport across the membrane. A few ions or molecules are transported across the membrane against their concentration gradient, i.e., from lower to the higher concentration. Such a transport is an energy dependent process, in which ATP is utilised and is called active transport, e. g., Na+/K+ Pump. 8.5.2 CellWall As you may recall, a non-living rigid structure called the cell wall forms an outer covering for the plasma membrane of fungi and plants. Cell wall not only gives shape to the cell and protects the cell from mechanical damage and infection, it also helps in cell-to-cell interaction and provides barrier to undesirable macromolecules. Algae have cell wall, made of cellulose, galactans, mannans and minerals like calcium carbonate, while in other plants it consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and proteins. The cell wall of a young plant cell, the primary wall is capable of growth, which gradually diminishes as the cell matures and the secondary wall is formed on the inner (towards membrane) side of the cell. The middle lamella is a layer mainly of calcium pectate which holds or glues the different neighbouring cells together. The cell wall and middle lamellae may be traversed by plasmodesmata which connect the cytoplasm of neighbouring cells. 8.5.3 Endomembrane System While each of the membranous organelles is distinct in terms of its"

biology/,"CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INrEGRATION 335 baby leading to stunted growth (cretinism), mental retardation, low intelligence quotient, abnormal skin, deaf-mutism, etc. In adult women, hypothyroidism may cause menstrual cycle to become irregular. Due to cancer of the thyroid gland or due to development of nodules of the thyroid glands, the rate of synthesis and secretion of the thyroid hormones is increased to abnormal high levels leading to a condition called hyperthyroidism which adversely affects the body physiology. Exopthalmic goitre is a form of hyperthyroidism, characterised by enlargement of the thyroid gland, protrusion of the eyeballs, increased basal metabolic rate, and weight loss, also called Graves’ disease. Thyroid hormones play an important role in the regulation of the basal metabolic rate. These hormones also support the process of red blood cell formation. Thyroid hormones control the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Maintenance of water and electrolyte balance is also inﬂuenced by thyroid hormones. Thyroid gland also secretes a protein hormone called thyrocalcitonin (TCT) which regulates the blood calcium levels. 22.2.5 Parathyroid Gland In humans, four parathyroid glands are present on the back side of the thyroid gland, one pair each in the two lobes of the thyroid gland (Figure 22.3b). The parathyroid glands secrete a peptide hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH). The secretion of PTH is regulated by the circulating levels of calcium ions. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases the Ca2+ levels in the blood. PTH acts on bones and stimulates the process of bone resorption (dissolution/ demineralisation). PTH also stimulates reabsorption of Ca2+ by the renal tubules and increases Ca2+ absorption from the digested food. It is, thus, clear that PI‘H is a hypercalcemic hormone, i.e., it increases the blood Ca2+ levels. Along with TCT, it plays a signiﬁcant role in calcium balance in the body. 22.2.6 Thymus The thymus gland is a lobular structure located between lungs behind sternum on the ventral side of aorta. The thymus plays a major role in the development of the immune system. This gland secretes the peptide hormones called thymosins. Thymosins play a major role in the differentiation of T-lymphocytes, which provide cell-mediated immunity. In addition, thymosins also promote production of antibodies to provide humoral immunity. Thymus is degenerated in old individuals resulting in a decreased production of thymosins. As a result, the immune responses of old persons become weak."

The term potential energy brings to one’s mind ‘stored’ energy. A stretched bow-string possesses potential energy. When it is released, the arrow ﬂies off at a great speed. The earth’s crust is not uniform, but has discontinuities and dislocations that are called fault lines. These fault lines in the earth’s crust are like ‘compressed springs’. They possess a large amount of potential energy. An earthquake results when these fault lines readjust. Thus, potential energy is the ‘stored energy’ by virtue of the position or configuration of a body. The body left to itself releases this stored energy in the form of kinetic energy. Let us make our notion of potential energy more concrete. The gravitational force on a ball of mass m is my . 9 may be treated as a constant near the earth surface. By ‘near’ we imply that the height h of the ball above the earth’s surface is very small compared to the earth’s radius RE(h <<RE) so that we can ignore the variation of 9 near the earth’s surface*. In what follows we have taken the upward direction to be positive. Let us raise the ball up to a height h The work done by the external agency against the gravitational force is mgh This work gets stored as potential energy. Gravitational potential energy of an object, as a function of the height h, is denoted by V(h) and it is the negative of work done by the gravitational force in raising the object to that height. V(h) = mgh If h is taken as a variable, it is easily seen that the gravitational force F equals the negative of the derivative of V(h) with respect to h. Thus, d F=——V =— dh (h) mg The negative sign indicates that the gravitational force is downward. When released, the ball comes down with an increasing speed. Just before it hits the ground, its speed is given by the kinematic relation, v2 2 29h This equation can be written as l 2 h —mv=m 2 g which shows that the gravitational potential energy of the object at height h, when the object is released, manifests itself as kinetic energy of the object on reaching the ground. Physically, the notion of potential energy is applicable only to the class of forces where work done against the force gets ‘stored up’ as energy. When external constraints are removed, it manifests itself as kinetic energy. Mathematically, (for simplicity, in one dimension) the potential * The variation of g with height is discussed in Chapter 8 on Gravitation. 2019-20"

Bioluminescence (the property of a living organism to emit light) is well-marked in ctenophores. Sexes are not separate. Reproduction takes place only by sexual means.

biology/,"252 BIOLOGY known that not only the duration of light period but that the duration of dark period is also of equal importance. Hence, it can be said that ﬂowering in certain plants depends not only on a combination of light and dark exposures but also their relative durations. This response of plants to periods of day/ night is termed photoperiodism. It is also interesting to note that while shoot apices modify themselves into ﬂowering apices prior to ﬂowering, they (i.e., shoot apices of plants) by themselves cannot percieve photoperiods. The site of perception of light/ dark duration are the leaves. It has been hypothesised that there is a hormonal substance(s) that is responsible for ﬂowering. This hormonal substance migrates from leaves to shoot apices for inducing ﬂowering only when the plants are exposed to the necessary inductive photoperiod. l 5.6 VERNALISATION There are plants for which ﬂowering is either quantitatively or qualitatively dependent on exposure to low temperature. This phenomenon is termed vernalisation. It prevents precocious reproductive development late in the growing season, and enables the plant to have sufficient time to reach maturity. Vernalisation refers specially to the promotion of ﬂowering by a period of low temperature. Some important food plants, wheat, barley, rye have two kinds of varieties: winter and spring varieties. The ‘spring’ variety are normally planted in the spring and come to ﬂower and produce grain before the end of the growing season. Winter varieties, however, if planted in spring would normally fail to ﬂower or produce mature grain within a span of a ﬂowering season. Hence, they are planted in autumn. They germinate, and over winter come out as small seedlings, resume growth in the spring, and are harvested usually around mid-summer. Another example of vernalisation is seen in biennial plants. Biennials are monocarpic plants that normally ﬂower and die in the second season. Sugarbeet, cabbages, carrots are some of the common biennials. Subjecting the growing of a biennial plant to a cold treatment stimulates a subsequent photoperiodic ﬂowering response. 15.7 SEED DORMANCY There are certain seeds which fail to germinate even when external conditions are favourable.

Between period t = 18 s to t = 20 s, it is uniformly decreasing and during the period t= 0 s to t = 10 s, it is increasing. Note that for uniform motion, velocity is the same as the average velocity at all instants. Instantaneous speed or simply speed is the magnitude of velocity. For example, a velocity of + 24.0 m S'1 and a velocity of— 24.0 m S'1 — both have an associated speed of 24.0 m s4. It should be noted that though average speed over a finite interval of time is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity, instantaneous speed at an instant is equal to the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity at that instant. Why so ? 3.5 ACCELERATION The velocity of an object, in general, changes during its course of motion. How to describe this change? Should it be described as the rate of change in velocity with distance or with time ? This was a problem even in Galileo’s time. It was first thought that this change could be described by the rate of change of velocity with distance. But, through his studies of motion of freely falling objects and motion of objects on an inclined plane, Galileo concluded that the rate of change of velocity with time is a constant of motion for all objects in free fall. On the other hand, the change in velocity with distance is not constant — it decreases with the increasing distance of fall. Average velocity = = 6.0><b This led to the concept of acceleration as the rate of change of velocity with time. The average acceleration 6 over a time interval is defined as the change of velocity divided by the time interval : ”2‘01 _ﬂ t2—tl At where v2 and D1 are the instantaneous velocities or simply velocities at time t2 and t1 .

physics/,"40 PHYSICS a rectangular coordinate system consisting of three mutually perpenducular axes, labelled X-, Y-, and Z- axes. The point of intersection of these three axes is called origin (0) and serves as the reference point. The coordinates (x, y. z) of an object describe the position of the object with respect to this coordinate system. To measure time, we position a clock in this system. This coordinate system along with a clock constitutes a frame of reference. If one or more coordinates of an object change with time, we say that the object is in motion. Otherwise, the object is said to be at rest with respect to this frame of reference. The choice of a set of axes in a frame of reference depends upon the situation. For example, for describing motion in one dimension, we need only one axis. To describe motion in two/ three dimensions, we need a set of two/ three axes. Description of an event depends on the frame of reference chosen for the description. For example, when you say that a car is moving on a road, you are describing the car with respect to a frame of reference attached to you or to the ground. But with respect to a frame of reference attached with a person sitting in the car, the car is at rest. To describe motion along a straight line, we can choose an axis, say X-axis, so that it coincides with the path of the object. We then measure the position of the object with reference to a conveniently chosen origin, say O, as shown in Fig. 3.1. Positions to the right of O are taken as positive and to the left of O, as negative. Following this convention, the position coordinates of point P and Q in Fig. 3.1 are +360 m and +240 m. Similarly, the position coordinate of point R is —120 m. Path length Consider the motion of a car along a straight line. We choose the x-axis such that it coincides R O with the path of the car’s motion and origin of the axis as the point from where the car started moving, i.e. the carwas at x= O at t= 0 (Fig. 3.1). Let P, Q and R represent the positions of the car at different instants of time. Consider two cases of motion. In the first case, the car moves from O to P. Then the distance moved by the car is OP = +360 m. This distance is called the path length traversed by the car. In the second case, the car moves from O to P and then moves back from P to Q. During this course of motion, the path length traversed is OP + PQ = + 360 m + (+120 m) = + 480 m. Path length is a scalar quantity — a quantity that has a magnitude only and no direction (see Chapter 4). Displacement It is useful to define another quantity displacement as the change in position. Let x1 and x2 be the positions of an object at time t1 and t2. Then its displacement, denoted by Ax, in time At = (t2 - t1), is given by the difference between the final and initial positions : Ax = x2— x1 (We use the Greek letter delta (A) to denote a change in a quantity.) If x2 > x1, Ax is positive; and if x2 < x1, Ax is negative. Displacement has both magnitude and direction. Such quantities are represented by vectors. You will read about vectors in the next chapter. Presently, we are dealing with motion along a straight line (also called rectilinear motion) only. In one-dimensional motion, there are only two directions (backward and forward, upward and downward) in which an object can move, and these two directions can easily be specified by + and — signs. For example, displacement of the car in moving from O to P is : Ax=x2—x1 = (+360 m) —Om= +360m The displacement has a magnitude of 360 m and is directed in the positive x direction as indicated by the + sign. Similarly, the displacement of the car from P to Q is 240 m— 360 m = — 120 m.

In grasses, certain adaxial epidermal cells along the veins modify themselves into large, empty, colourless cells. These are called bulliform cells. When the bulliform cells in the leaves have absorbed water and are turgid, the leaf surface is exposed. When they are ﬂaccid due to water stress, they make the leaves curl inwards to minimise water loss. The parallel venation in monocot leaves is reﬂected in the near similar sizes of vascular bundles (except in main veins) as seen in vertical sections of the leaves. 6.4 SECONDARY GROWTH The growth of the roots and stems in length with the help of apical meristem is called the primary growth. Apart from primary growth most dicotyledonous plants exhibit an increase in girth. This increase is called the secondary growth. The tissues involved in secondary growth are the two lateral meristems: vascular cambium and cork cambium. 6.4. 1 Vascular Cambium The meristematic layer that is responsible for cutting off vascular tissues — xylem and pholem — is called vascular cambium. In the young stem it is present in patches as a single layer between the xylem and phloem. Later it forms a complete ring. 6.4.1.1 Formation of cambial ring In dicot stems, the cells of cambium present between primary xylem and primary phloem is the intrafascicular cambium."
physics/,"MOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE APPENDIX 3.1 : ELEMENTS OF CALCULUS Differential Calculus Using the concept of ‘differential coefficient’ or ‘derivative’, we can easily define velocity and acceleration. Though you will learn in detail in mathematics about derivatives, we shall introduce this concept in brief in this Appendix so as to facilitate its use in describing physical quantities involved in motion. Suppose we have a quantity y whose value depends upon a single van'able x, and is expressed by an equation defining y as some specific function of x. This is represented as: y=fm (D This relationship can be visualised by drawing a graph of function y = f (x) regarding y and x as Cartesian coordinates, as shown in Fig. 3.30 (a). A :f A y y (X) y (a) (b) Fig. 3.30 Consider the point P on the curve y = f (x) whose coordinates are (x, y) and another point Q where coordinates are (x + Ax, y + Ay). The slope of the line joining P and Q is given by: _Ay_(y+Ay)—y tan _E——AX (2) Suppose now that the point Q moves along the curve towards P. In this process, Ay and Ax decrease and approach zero; though their ratio ﬂ will not necessarily vanish. What happens Ax to the line PQ as Ay—> O, Axe 0. You can see that this line becomes a tangent to the curve at point P as shown in Fig. 3.30(b). This means that tan 6 approaches the slope of the tangent at P, denoted by m: Ay (y + Ay) — y m=ggm=m— (3) The limit of the ratio Ay/Ax as Ax approaches zero is called the derivative of y with respect to x and is written as dy/dx. It represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = f (x) at the point (x, y).

Suppose an insect climbs up a ramp and falls down, it comes back to the initial point and repeats the process identically. If you draw a graph of its height above the ground versus time, it would look something like Fig. 14. 1 (a). If a child climbs up a step, comes down, and repeats the process identically, its height above the ground would look like that in Fig. 14. 1 (b). When you play the game of bouncing a ball off the ground, between your palm and the ground. its height versus time graph would look like the one in Fig. 14. 1 (c). Note that both the curved parts in Fig. 14.1 (c) are sections of a parabola given by the Newton’s equation of motion (see section 3.6), h = lit +5 gt2 for downward motion, and l h = ut — E gt2 for upward motion, with different values of u in each case. These are examples of periodic motion. Thus, a motion that repeats itself at regular intervals of time is called periodic motion. x(t) (b) x(t) (c) T Fig. 14.1 Examples of periodic motion. The period T is shown in each case. 2019-20 Very often, the body undergoing periodic motion has an equilibrium position somewhere inside its path. When the body is at this position no net external force acts on it. Therefore, if it is left there at rest, it remains there forever. If the body is given a small displacement from the position, a force comes into play which tries to bring the body back to the equilibrium point, giving rise to oscillations or vibrations. For example, a ball placed in a bowl will be in equilibrium at the bottom. If displaced a little from the point, it will perform oscillations in the bowl. Every oscillatory motion is periodic, but every periodic motion need not be oscillatory. Circular motion is a periodic motion, but it is not oscillatory. There is no significant difference between oscillations and vibrations. It seems that when the frequency is small, we call it oscillation (like, the oscillation of a branch of a tree), while when the frequency is high, we call it vibration (like, the vibration of a string of a musical instrument). Simple harmonic motion is the simplest form of oscillatory motion. This motion arises when the force on the oscillating body is directly proportional to its displacement from the mean position, which is also the equilibrium position. Further, at any point in its oscillation, this force is directed towards the mean position. In practice, oscillating bodies eventually come to rest at their equilibrium positions because of the damping due to friction and other dissipative causes. However, they can be forced to remain oscillating by means of some external periodic agency. We discuss the phenomena of damped and forced oscillations later in the chapter. Any material medium can be pictured as a collection of a large number of coupled oscillators. The collective oscillations of the constituents of a medium manifest themselves as waves. Examples of waves include water waves, seismic waves, electromagnetic waves. We shall study the wave phenomenon in the next chapter. 14.2.1 Period and frequency We have seen that any motion that repeats itself at regular intervals of time is called periodic motion. The smallest interval of time after which the motion is repeated is called its period. Let us denote the period by the symbol T. Its SI unit is second. For periodic motions,"

Have you ever thought about where and how the structures like roots, stems, leaves, ﬂowers, fruits and seeds arise and that too in an orderly sequence? You are, by now, aware of the terms seed, seedling, plantlet, mature plant. You have also seen that trees continue to increase in height or girth over a period of time. However, the leaves, ﬂowers and fruits of the same tree not only have limited dimensions but also appear and fall periodically and some time repeatedly. Why does vegetative phase precede ﬂowering in a plant? All plant organs are made up of a variety of tissues; is there any relationship between the structure of a cell, a tissue, an organ and the function they perform? Can the structure and the function of these be altered? All cells of a plant are descendents of the zygote. The question is, then, why and how do they have different structural and functional attributes? Development is the sum of two processes: growth and differentiation. To begin with, it is essential and sufficient to know that the development of a mature plant from a zygote (fertilised egg) follow a precise and highly ordered succession of events. During this process a complex body organisation is formed that produces roots, leaves, branches, ﬂowers, fruits, and seeds, and eventually they die (Figure 1 5.1). The first step in the process of plant growth is seed germination. The seed germinates when favourable conditions for growth exist in the environment. In absence of such favourable conditions the seeds do not germinate and goes into a period of suspended growth or rest. Once favourable conditions return, the seeds resume metabolic activities and growth takes place. In this chapter, you shall also study some of the factors which govern and control these developmental processes. These factors are both intrinsic (internal) and extrinsic (external) to the plant. 2019-2020"

biology/,"126 BIOLOGY Schwann (1 839), a British Zoologist, studied different types of animal cells and reported that cells had a thin outer layer which is today known as the ‘plasma membrane’. He also concluded, based on his studies on plant tissues, that the presence of cell wall is a unique character of the plant cells. On the basis of this, Schwann proposed the hypothesis that the bodies of animals and plants are composed of cells and products of cells. Schleiden and Schwann together formulated the cell theory. This theory however, did not explain as to how new cells were formed. Rudolf Virchow (1855) ﬁrst explained that cells divided and new cells are formed from pre-existing cells (Omnis cellula—e cellula). He modiﬁed the hypothesis of Schleiden and Schwann to give the cell theory a ﬁnal shape. Cell theory as understood today is: (i) all living organisms are composed of cells and products of cells. (ii) all cells arise from pre-existing cells. 8.3 AN OVERVIEW OF CELL You have earlier observed cells in an onion peel and/ or human cheek cells under the microscope. Let us recollect their structure. The onion cell which is a typical plant cell, has a distinct cell wall as its outer boundary and just within it is the cell membrane. The cells of the human cheek have an outer membrane as the delimiting structure of the cell. Inside each cell is a dense membrane bound structure called nucleus. This nucleus contains the chromosomes which in turn contain the genetic material, DNA. Cells that have membrane bound nuclei are called eukaryotic whereas cells that lack a membrane bound nucleus are prokaryotic. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, a semi-ﬂuid matrix called cytoplasm occupies the volume of the cell. The cytoplasm is the main arena of cellular activities in both the plant and animal cells. Various chemical reactions occur in it to keep the cell in the ‘living state’. Besides the nucleus, the eukaryotic cells have other membrane bound distinct structures called organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the golgi complex, lysosomes, mitochondria, microbodies and vacuoles. The prokaryotic cells lack such membrane bound organelles. Ribosomes are non-membrane bound organelles found in all cells — both eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic. Within the cell, ribosomes are found not only in the cytoplasm but also within the two organelles — chloroplasts (in plants) and mitochondria and on rough ER. Animal cells contain another non-membrane bound organelle called centrosome which helps in cell division. Cells differ greatly in size, shape and activities (Figure 8. 1). For example, Mycoplasmas, the smallest cells, are only 0.3 pm in length while bacteria"

However, secondary growth does not occur in monocotyledons. SUMMARY Anatomically, a plant is made of different kinds of tissues. The plant tissues are broadly classiﬁed into meristematic (apical, lateral and intercalary) and permanent (simple and complex). Assimilation of food and its storage, transportation of water, minerals and photosynthates, and mechanical support are the main functions of tissues. There are three types oftissue Systems — epidermal, ground and vascular. The epidermal tissue systems are made of epidermal cells, stomata and the epidermal appendages. The ground tissue system forms the main bulk of the plant. It is divided into three Zones — cortex, pericycle and pith. The vascular tissue system is formed by the xylem and phloem. On the basis of presence of cambium, location of xylem and phloem, the vascular bundles are of different types. The vascular bundles form the conducting tissue and translocate water, minerals and food material."

biology/,"Rate of photosynthesis 222 BIOLOGY 13. 10 FACTORS AFFECTING PHOTOSYNTHESIS An understanding of the factors that affect photosynthesis is necessary. The rate of photosynthesis is very important in determining the yield of plants including crop plants. Photosynthesis is under the inﬂuence of several factors, both internal (plant) and external. The plant factors include the number, size, age and orientation of leaves, mesophyll cells and chloroplasts, internal CO2 concentration and the amount of chlorophyll. The plant or internal factors are dependent on the genetic predisposition and the growth of the plant. The external factors would include the availability of sunlight, temperature, CO2 concentration and water. As a plant photosynthesises, all these factors will simultaneously affect its rate. Hence, though several factors interact and simultaneously affect photosynthesis or CO2 ﬁxation, usually one factor is the major cause or is the one that limits the rate. Hence, at any point the rate will be determined by the factor available at sub-optimal levels. When several factors affect any [bio] chemical process, Blackman’s (1905) Law of Limiting Factors comes into effect. This states the following: If a chemical process is affected by more than one factor, then its rate will be determined by the factor which is nearest to its minimal value: it is the factor which directly affects the process if its quantity is changed. For example, despite the presence of a green leaf and optimal light and CO2 conditions, the plant may not photosynthesise if the temperature is very low. This leaf, if given the optimal temperature, will start photosynthesising. 13.1o.1 Light We need to distinguish between light quality, light intensity and the duration of exposure to light, while discussing light as a factor that affects photosynthesis. There is a linear relationship between incident light and CO2 ﬁxation rates at low light intensities. At higher light intensities, gradually the rate does not show further increase as other factors become limiting (Figure 13.10). Light intenSitY What is interesting to note is that light saturation occurs at 10 per cent of the full sunlight. Hence, Figure 13. 10 Graph of light intensity on the except for plants in shade or in dense forests, light rate of photosynthesis is rarely a limiting factor in nature. Increase in"
geography/,"118 Tides of Bay of Fundy, Canada The highest tides in the world occur in the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia, Canada. The tidal bulge is 15 - 16 m. Because there are two high tides and two low tides every day (roughly a 24 hour period); then a tide must come in within about a six hour period. As a rough estimate, the tide rises about 240 cm an hour (1,440 cm divided by 6 hours). If you have walked down a beach with a steep cliff alongside (which is common there), make sure you watch the tides. If you walk for about an hour and then notice that the tide is coming in, the water will be over your head before you get back to where you started! Types of Tides Tides vary in their frequency, direction and movement from place to place and also from time to time. Tides may be grouped into various types based on their frequency of occurrence in one day or 24 hours or based on their height. Tides based on Frequency Semi-diurnal tide : The most common tidal pattern, featuring two high tides and two low tides each day. The successive high or low tides are approximately of the same height. Diurnal tide :There is only one high tide and one low tide during each day. The successive high and low tides are approximately of the same height. Mixed tide :Tides having variations in height are known as mixed tides. These tides generally occur along the west coast of North America and on many islands of the Paciﬁc Ocean. Tides based on the Sun, Moon and the Earth Positions The height of rising water (high tide) varies appreciably depending upon the position of sun and moon with respect to the earth. Spring tides and neap tides come under this category. FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY Spring tides : The position of both the sun and the moon in relation to the earth has direct bearing on tide height. When the sun, the moon and the earth are in a straight line, the height of the tide will be higher. These are called spring tides and they occur twice a month, one on full moon period and another during new moon period. Neap tides : Normally, there is a seven day interval between the spring tides and neap tides. At this time the sun and moon are at right angles to each other and the forces of the sun and moon tend to counteract one another. The Moon’s attraction, though more than twice as strong as the sun’s, is diminished by the counteracting force of the sun’s gravitational pull. Once in a month, when the moon’s orbit is closest to the earth (perigee), unusually high and low tides occur. During this time the tidal range is greater than normal. ’Rvo weeks later, when the moon is farthest from earth (apogee), the moon’s gravitational force is limited and the tidal ranges are less than their average heights. When the earth is closest to the sun (perihelion), around 3rd January each year, tidal ranges are also much greater, with unusually high and unusually low tides. When the earth is farthest from the sun (aphelion), around 4th July each year, tidal ranges are much less than average. The time between the high tide and low tide, when the water level is falling, is called the ebb. The time between the low tide and high tide, when the tide is rising, is called the ﬂow or ﬂood. Importance of Tides Since tides are caused by the earth-moon-sun positions which are known accurately, the tides can be predicted well in advance. This helps the navigators and ﬁshermen plan their activities. Tidal ﬂows are of great importance in navigation. Tidal heights are very important, especially harbours near rivers and within estuaries having shallow ‘bars’ at the entrance, which prevent ships and boats from entering into the harbour. Tides are also helpful in 2019-2020"
geography/,"GEOGRAPHY AS A DISCIPLINE Put together, they mean description of the earth. The earth has always been seen as the abode of human beings and thus, scholars deﬁned geography as, “the description of the earth as the abode of human beings”. You are aware of the fact that reality is always multifaceted and the ‘earth’ is also multi-dimensional, that is why many disciplines from natural sciences such as geology, pedology, oceanography, botany, zoology and meteorology and a number of sister disciplines in social sciences such as economics, history, sociology, political science, anthropology, etc. study different aspects of the earth’s surface. Geography is different from other sciences in its subject matter and methodology but at the same time, it is closely related to other disciplines. Geography derives its data base from all the natural and social sciences and attempts their synthesis. We have noted that there exist variations over the surface of the earth in its physical as well as cultural environment. A number of phenomena are similar and many are dissimilar. It was, therefore, logical to perceive geography as the study of areal differentiation. Thus, geography was perceived to study all those phenomena which vary over space. Geographers do not study only the variations in the phenomena over the earth’s surface (space) but also study the associations with the other factors which cause these variations. For example, cropping patterns differ from region to region but this variation in cropping pattern, as a phenomenon, is related to variations in soils, climates, demands in the market, capacity of the farmer to invest and technological inputs available to her/ him. Thus, the concern of geography is to find out the causal relationship between any two phenomena or between more than one phenomenon. A geographer explains the phenomena in a frame of cause and effect relationship, as it does not only help in interpretation but also foresees the phenomena in future. The geographical phenomena, both the physical and human, are not static but highly dynamic. They change over time as a result of the interactive processes between ever 3 changing earth and untiring and ever-active human beings. Primitive human societies were directly dependent on their immediate environment. Geography, thus, is concerned with the study of Nature and Human interactions as an integrated whole. ‘Human’ is an integral part of ‘nature’ and ‘nature’ has the imprints of ‘human’. ‘Nature’ has inﬂuenced different aspects of human life. Its imprints can be noticed on food, clothing, shelter and occupation. Human beings have come to terms with nature through adaptation and modiﬁcation. As you already know, the present society has passed the stage of primitive societies, which were directly dependent on their immediate physical environment for sustenance. Present societies have modified their natural environment by inventing and using technology and thus, have expanded the horizon of their operation by appropriating and utilising the resources provided by nature. With the gradual development of technology, human beings were able to loosen the shackles of their physical environment. Technology helped in reducing the harshness of labour, increased labour efficiency and provided leisure to human beings to attend to the higher needs of life. It also increased the scale of production and the mobility of labour. The interaction between the physical environment and human beings has been very succinctly described by a poet in the following dialogue between ‘human’ and ‘nature’ (God). You created the soil, I created the cup, you created night, I created the lamp. You created wilderness, hilly terrains and deserts; I created ﬂower beds and gardens. Human beings have claimed their contribution using natural resources. With the help of technology, human beings moved from the stage of necessity to a stage of freedom. They have put their imprints everywhere and created new possibilities in collaboration with nature. Thus, we now find humanised nature and naturalised human beings and geography studies this interactive relationship. The space got organised with the help of the means of transportation and communication network. The links (routes) and nodes (settlements of all types and hierarchies) integrated the space and 2019-2020"

physics/,"262 PHYSICS Aerofoil or lift on aircraft wing: Figure 10.13 (c) shows an aerofoil, which is a solid piece shaped to provide an upward dynamic lift when it moves horizontally through air. The cross- section of the wings of an aeroplane looks somewhat like the aerofoil shown in Fig. 10.13 (c) with streamlines around it. When the aerofoil moves against the wind, the orientation of the wing relative to ﬂow direction causes the streamlines to crowd together above the wing more than those below it. The ﬂow speed on top is higher than that below it. There is an upward force resulting in a dynamic lift of the wings and this balances the weight of the plane. The following example illustrates this. Example 1 0.8 A fully loaded Boeing aircraft has a mass of 3.3 x 105 kg. Its total wing area is 500 n12. It is in level ﬂight with a speed of 960 km/h. (a) Estimate the pressure difference between the lower and upper surfaces of the wings (b) Estimate the fractional increase in the speed of the air on the upper surface of the wing relative to the lower surface. [The density of air is p = 1.2 kg m’“] Answer (a) The weight of the Boeing aircraft is balanced by the upward force due to the pressure difference APXA=3.3 x 105ng 9.8 Ap= (3.3x 105 kg>< 9.8mS'2) / 500 m2 = 6.5 X 103 Nm‘2 (b) We ignore the small height difference between the top and bottom sides in Eq.

The pressure difference between them is then AP=§<U§ —v12) where U2 is the speed of air over the upper surface and U1 is the speed under the bottom surface. 2019-20 Taking the average speed Dav = (v2+ v1)/2 = 960 km/h = 267 m s1, we have AP 1) — v v 2 ~ ( 2 l)/ av pviv—v 0.08 The speed above the wing needs to be only 8 % higher than that below. 4 10.5 VISCOSITY Most of the ﬂuids are not ideal ones and offer some resistance to motion. This resistance to ﬂuid motion is like an intemal friction analogous to ﬁ'iction when a solid moves on a surface. It is called viscosity. This force exists when there is relative motion between layers of the liquid. Suppose we consider a ﬂuid like oil enclosed between two glass plates as shown in Fig. 1 O. 14 (a). The bottom plate is ﬁxed while the top plate is moved with a constant velocity v relative to the fixed plate. If oil is replaced by honey, a greater force is required to move the plate with the same velocity. Hence we say that honey is more viscous than oil. The ﬂuid in contact with a surface has the same velocity as that of the surfaces. Hence, the layer of the liquid in contact with top surface moves with a velocity v and the layer of the liquid in contact with the fixed surface is stationary. The velocities of layers increase uniformly from bottom (zero velocity) to the top layer (velocity v). For any layer of liquid, its upper layer pulls it forward while lower layer pulls it backward. This results in force between the layers. This type of ﬂow is known as laminar. The layers of liquid slide over one another as the pages of a book do when it is placed ﬂat on a table and a horizontal force is applied to the top cover. When a ﬂuid is ﬂowing in a pipe or a tube, then velocity of the liquid layer along the axis of the tube is maximum and decreases gradually as we move towards the walls where it becomes zero, Fig. 10.14 (b). The velocity on a cylindrical surface in a tube is constant. On account of this motion, a portion of liquid, which at some instant has the shape ABCD, take the shape of AEFD after short interval of time"
physics/,"148 PHYSICS of Fig. 7.1 1 had different masses. How will you then determine the centre of mass of the lamina? 4 7.3 MOTION OF CENTRE OF MASS Equipped with the definition of the centre of mass, we are now in a position to discuss its physical importance for a system of n particles. We may rewrite Eq.(7.4d) as MR: Zmiri =m1r1 +m2r2 +...+mnrn (7.7) Differentiating the two sides of the equation with respect to time we get dR dr1 dr2 drn M—=m1—+m2—+...+mn dt dt dt dt or MV=mlv1+m2v2+m+mnvn (7.8) where v1 (= dr1 / dt) is the velocity of the first particle v2 (=dr2/dt) is the velocity of the second particle etc. and V = dR/dt is the velocity of the centre of mass. Note that we assumed the masses m1, m2, etc. do not change in time. We have therefore, treated them as constants in differentiating the equations with respect to time. Differentiating Eq.(7.8) with respect to time, we obtain dV dv1 dv2 dv,L M—=m1—+m2 +...+m,l dt dt dt dt or MAzmla1 +m2a2 +...+mnan (7.9) where 1':11(=dv1 /dt) is the acceleration of the first particle, 32 (= dv2 / dt) is the acceleration of the second particle etc. and A (2 dV / dt) is the acceleration of the centre of mass of the system of particles. Now, from Newton’s second law, the force acting on the first particle is given by F1 = mla1 . The force acting on the second particle is given by F2 = m2a2 and so on. Eq. (7.9) may be written as MA=F1+F2+...+Fn (7.10) 2019-20 Thus, the total mass of a system of particles times the acceleration of its centre of mass is the vector sum of all the forces acting on the system of particles. Note when we talk of the force F1 on the first particle, it is not a single force, but the vector sum of all the forces on the ﬁrst particle; likewise for the second particle etc. Among these forces on each particle there will be external forces exerted by bodies outside the system and also internal forces exerted by the particles on one another. We know from Newton’s third law that these internal forces occur in equal and opposite pairs and in the sum of forces of Eq. (7.10), their contribution is zero. Only the external forces contribute to the equation. We can then rewrite Eq. (7 . 10) as IWA=FM (7.11) where Fext represents the sum of all external forces acting on the particles of the system. Eq. (7.1 1) states that the centre of mass of a system of particles moves as if all the mass of the system was concentrated at the centre of mass and all the external forces were applied at that point. Notice, to determine the motion of the centre of mass no knowledge of internal forces of the system of particles is required; for this purpose we need to know only the external forces. To obtain Eq. (7. 1 1) we did not need to specify the nature of the system of particles. The system may be a collection of particles in which there may be all kinds of internal motions, or it may be a rigid body which has either pure translational motion or a combination of translational and rotational motion. Whatever is the system and the motion of its individual particles, the centre of mass moves according to Eq. (7 . 1 1). Instead of treating extended bodies as single particles as we have done in earlier chapters, we can now treat them as systems of particles. We can obtain the translational component of their motion, i.e. the motion of the centre of mass of the system, by taking the mass of the whole system to be concentrated at the centre of mass and all the external forces on the system to be acting at the centre of mass. This is the procedure that we followed earlier in analysing forces on bodies and solving"
physics/,"158 PHYSICS Answer Let the particle with velocity v be at point P at some instant t. We want to calculate the angular momentum of the particle about an arbitrary point 0. 0 Fig 7.19 The angular momentum is l = rX mv. Its magnitude is mvr sine, where 0 is the angle between 1' and v as shown in Fig. 7. 19. Although the particle changes position with time, the line of direction of v remains the same and hence OM = r sin 0. is a constant. Further, the direction of l is perpendicular to the plane of r and v. It is into the page of the figure.This direction does not change with time. Thus, 1 remains the same in magnitude and direction and is therefore conserved. Is there any external torque on the particle? 4 7.8 EQUILIBRIUM OF A RIGID BODY We are now going to concentrate on the motion of rigid bodies rather than on the motion of general systems of particles. We shall recapitulate what effect the external forces have on a rigid body. (Henceforth we shall omit the adjective ‘external’ because unless stated otherwise, we shall deal with only external forces and torques.) The forces change the translational state of the motion of the rigid body, i.e. they change its total linear momentum in accordance with Eq. (7.17). But this is not the only effect the forces have. The total torque on the body may not vanish. Such a torque changes the rotational state of motion of the rigid body, i.e. it changes the total angular momentum of the body in accordance with Eq. (7 .28 b). A rigid body is said to be in mechanical equilibrium, if both its linear momentum and angular momentum are not changing with time, or equivalently, the body has neither linear 2019-20 acceleration nor angular acceleration. This means (1) the total force, i.e. the vector sum of the forces, on the rigid body is zero; F1+F2+...+FH=ZFi=0 (7.30a) i=1 If the total force on the body is zero, then the total linear momentum of the body does not change with time. Eq. (7 .30a) gives the condition for the translational equilibrium of the body. (2) The total torque, i.e. the vector sum of the torques on the rigid body is zero, 121+152+...+‘Cn=z12i=0 (7.30b) i=1 If the total torque on the rigid body is zero, the total angular momentum of the body does not change with time. Eq. (7.30 b) gives the condition for the rotational equilibrium of the body. One may raise a question, whether the rotational equilibrium condition [Eq. 7 .30(b)] remains valid, if the origin with respect to which the torques are taken is shifted. One can show that if the translational equilibrium condition [Eq. 7 .30(a)] holds for a rigid body, then such a shift of origin does not matter, i.e. the rotational equilibrium condition is independent of the location of the origin about which the torques are taken. Example 7.7 gives a proof of this result in a special case of a couple, i.e. two forces acting on a rigid body in translational equilibrium. The generalisation of this result to n forces is left as an exercise. Eq. (7 .30a) and Eq. (7 .30b), both, are vector equations. They are equivalent to three scalar equations each. Eq. (7 .30a) corresponds to ;Fm=0, gmy=0 and gFiz=o (7.31a) where Fix, Fig and Fiz are respectively the x, y and 2 components of the forces Fi. Similarly, Eq. (7.30b) is equivalent to three scalar equations Tiy : O and £712 2 O (7.31b) i=1 1. =0 IX 5 n n i=1 [:1 where 170‘, fig and 11.2 are respectively the x, y and 2 components of the torque 1.- ."
physics/,"196 PHYSICS Considering gravitational potential energy at infinity to be zero, the potential energy at distance (Re+h) from the centre of the earth is GmME (RE—+h) (8.41) The K.E is positive whereas the PE is negative. However, in magnitude the K.E. is half the RE, so that the total E is G m ME 2(RE +h) (842) The total energy of an circularly orbiting satellite is thus negative, with the potential energy being negative but twice is magnitude of the positive kinetic energy. When the orbit of a satellite becomes elliptic, both the K.E. and RE. vary from point to point. The total energy which remains constant is negative as in the circular orbit case. This is what we expect, since as we have discussed before if the total energy is positive or zero, the object escapes to infinity.

(8.37) becomes equal to 24 hours. If the circular orbit is in the equatorial plane of the earth, such a satellite, having the same period as the period of rotation of the earth about its own axis would appear stationery viewed from a point on earth. The (RE + h) for this purpose works out to be large as compared to RE : (8.43) T2GM “3 tar—E] 47!2 and for T= 24 hours, hworks out to be 35800 km. which is much larger than RE. Satellites in a circular orbits around the earth in the equatorial plane with T = 24 hours are called Geostationery Satellites. Clearly, since the earth rotates with the same period, the satellite would appear fixed from any point on earth. It takes very powerful rockets to throw up a satellite to such large heights above the earth but this has been done in view of the several benefits of many practical applications. Fig. 8.1 1 A Polar satellite. A strip on earth’s surface (shown shaded) is visible from the satellite during one cycle. For the next revolution of the satellite, the earth has rotated a little on its axis so that an adjacent strip becomes visible. It is known that electromagnetic waves above a certain frequency are not reﬂected from ionosphere. Radio waves used for radio broadcast which are in the frequency range 2 MHZ to 10 MHZ, are below the critical frequency. They are therefore reﬂected by the ionosphere."
biology/,"DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION like structure called stomach. A muscular sphincter (gastro-oesophageal) regulates the opening of oesophagus into the stomach. The stomach, located in the upper left portion of the abdominal cavity, has four major parts — a cardiac portion into which the oesophagus opens, a fundic region, body (main central region) and a pyloric portion which opens into the ﬁrst part of small intestine (Figure 16.3). Small intestine is distinguishable into three regions, a ‘C’ shaped duodenum, a long coiled middle portion jejunum and a highly coiled ileum. The opening of the stomach into the duodenum is guarded by the pyloric sphincter. Ileum opens into the large intestine. It consists of caecum, colon and rectum. Caecum is a small blind sac which hosts some symbiotic micro-organisms. A narrow ﬁnger-like tubular projection, the vermiform appendix which is a vestigial organ, arises from the caecum. The caecum opens into the colon. The colon is divided into four parts — an ascending, a transverse, descending part and a sigmoid colon. The descending part opens into the rectum which opens out through the anus. The wall of alimentary canal from oesophagus to rectum possesses four layers (Figure 16.4) namely serosa, muscularis, sub-mucosa and mucosa. Serosa is the outermost layer and is made up of a thin mesothelium (epithelium of visceral organs) with some connective tissues. Muscularis is formed by smooth muscles usually arranged into an inner circular and an outer longitudinal layer. An oblique muscle layer may be present in some regions. The sub- mucosal layer is formed of loose connective tissues containing nerves, blood and lymph vessels. In duodenum, glands are also present in sub-mucosa. The innermost layer lining the lumen of the alimentary canal is the mucosa. This layer forms irregular folds (rugae) in the stomach and small ﬁnger-like foldings called villi in the small intestine (Figure 1 6.5). The cells lining the villi produce numerous microscopic i2 Figure 16.2 Arrangement of different types of teeth in the jaws on one side and the sockets on the other side Ocsophagus Fund! 15 Cardiac Supe rior portion of duodenum Body Pylorit‘ Figure 16.3 Anatomical regions of human stomach"

It comprises a single layer of barrel-shaped cells without any intercellular spaces. The tangential as well as radial walls of the endodermal cells have a deposition of water-impermeable, waxy material suberin in the form of casparian strips. Next to endodermis lies a few layers of thick-walled parenchyomatous cells referred to as pericycle. Initiation of lateral roots and vascular cambium during the secondary growth takes place in these cells. The pith is small or inconspicuous.

Worms have specialised chemoreceptors (taste receptors) which react to chemical stimuli. These sense organs are located on the anterior part of the worm. Earthworm is hermaphrodite (bisexual), i.e., testes and ovaries are present in the same individual (Figure 7.13). There are two pairs of testes present in the 10th and 1 1th segments. Their vasa deferentia run up to the 1 8th segment where they join the prostatic duct. Two pairs of accessory glands are present one pair each in the 1 7th and 19th segments. The common prostate and spermatic duct (vasa deferentia) opens to the exterior by a pair of male genital pores on the ventro-lateral side of the 18th segment. Four pairs of spermathecae are located in 631-9th segments (one pair in each segment). They receive and store spermatozoa during copulation. One pair of ovaries is attached at the inter-segmental septum of the 12th and 13th segments. Ovarian funnels are present beneath the ovaries which continue into oviduct, join together and open on the ventral side as a single median female genital pore on the 14th segment. A mutual exchange of sperm occurs between two worms during mating. One worm has to ﬁnd another worm and they mate juxtaposing opposite gonadal openings exchanging packets of sperms called spermatophores. Mature sperm and egg cells and nutritive ﬂuid are deposited in cocoons produced by the gland cells of clitellum. Fertilisation and development occur within the cocoons which are deposited in soil. The ova (eggs) are fertilised by the sperm cells within the cocoon which then slips off the worm and is deposited in or on the soil. The cocoon holds the worm embryos. After about 3 weeks, each cocoon produces two to twenty baby worms with an average of four. Development of earthworms is direct, i.e., there is no larva formed. 2019-2020"
geography/,"WATER IN THE ATMOSPHERE long. Such rain is common in the summer or in the hotter part of the day. It is very common in the equatorial regions and interior parts of the continents, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Orographic Rain When the saturated air mass comes across a mountain, it is forced to ascend and as it rises, it expands; the temperature falls, and the moisture is condensed. The chief characteristic of this sort of rain is that the windward slopes receive greater rainfall. After giving rain on the windward side, when these winds reach the other slope, they descend, and their temperature rises. Then their capacity to take in moisture increases and hence, these leeward slopes remain rainless and dry. The area situated on the leeward side, which gets less rainfall is known as the rain-shadow area. It is also known as the relief rain. Cyclonic Rain You have already read about extra tropical cyclones and cyclonic rain in Chapter 10. Please consult Chapter 10 to understand cyclonic rainfall. World Distribution of Rainfall Different places on the earth’s surface receive different amounts of rainfall in a year and that too in different seasons. In general, as we proceed from the equator towards the poles, rainfall goes on decreasing steadily. The coastal areas of the world receive greater amounts of rainfall than the interior of 97 the continents. The rainfall is more over the oceans than on the landmasses of the world because of being great sources of water. Between the latitudes 35° and 400 N and S of the equator, the rain is heavier on the eastern coasts and goes on decreasing towards the west. But, between 450 and 650 N and S of equator, due to the westerlies, the rainfall is first received on the western margins of the continents and it goes on decreasing towards the east. Wherever mountains run parallel to the coast, the rain is greater on the coastal plain, on the windward side and it decreases towards the leeward side. On the basis of the total amount of annual precipitation, major precipitation regimes of the world are identified as follows. The equatorial belt, the windward slopes of the mountains along the western coasts in the cool temperate zone and the coastal areas of the monsoon land receive heavy rainfall of over 200 cm per annum. Interior continental areas receive moderate rainfall varying from 100 - 200 cm per annum. The coastal areas of the continents receive moderate amount of rainfall. The central parts of the tropical land and the eastern and interior parts of the temperate lands receive rainfall varying between 50 - 100 cm per annum. Areas lying in the rain shadow zone of the interior of the continents and high latitudes receive very low rainfall-less than 50 cm per annum. Seasonal distribution of rainfall provides an important aspect to judge its effectiveness. In some regions rainfall is distributed evenly throughout the year such as in the equatorial belt and in the western parts of cool temperate regions. EXERCISES 1. Multiple choice questions.

The figure shows a planar body. An axis perpendicular to the body through a point 0 is taken as the z—axis. Two mutually perpendicular axes lying in the plane of the body and concurrent with z—axis, i.e., passing through 0, are taken as the x and y-axes. The theorem states that [Z = IX + 1y (7.36) Let us look at the usefulness of the theorem through an example. > Example 7.10 What is the moment of inertia of a disc about one of its diameters? Fig. 7.30 Moment of inertia of a disc about a diameter, given its moment of inertia about the perpendicular axis through its centre. 2019-20 Answer We assume the moment of inertia of the disc about an axis perpendicular to it and through its centre to be known; it is MR2/ 2, where M is the mass of the disc and R is its radius (Table 7.1) The disc can be considered to be a planar body. Hence the theorem of perpendicular axes is applicable to it. As shown in Fig. 7 .30, we take three concurrent axes through the centre of the disc, 0, as the x—, y— and z—axes; x— and y—axes lie in the plane of the disc and z—axis is perpendicular to it. By the theorem of perpendicular axes, IZ=IX+Iy Now, x and y axes are along two diameters of the disc, and by symmetry the moment of inertia of the disc is the same about any diameter. Hence IX = Iy and IZ = 21X But 12 = MR2/ 2 So finally, IX = [2/2 = MR2/4 Thus the moment of inertia of a disc about any of its diameter is MR2 / 4 . 4 Find similarly the moment of inertia of a ring about any of its diameters.

This is not always the case, as you will see in the following example. > Example 3.1 A car is moving along a straight line. say OP in Fig. 3.1.

This happens because the motion here involves change in direction so that the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement. This shows that speed is, in general, greater than the magnitude of the velocity. 4 If the car in Example 3.1 moves from O to P and comes back to O in the same time interval, average speed is 20 m/s but the average velocity is zero ! 3.4 INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY AND SPEED The average velocity tells us how fast an object has been moving over a given time interval but does not tell us how fast it moves at different instants of time during that interval. For this, we define instantaneous velocity or simply velocity v at an instant t. The velocity at an instant is defined as the limit of the average velocity as the time interval Atbecomes infinitesimally small. In other words, .

The entire process of response to a peripheral nervous stimulation, that occurs involuntarily, i.e., without conscious effort or thought and requires the involvment of a part of the central nervous system is called a reﬂex action. The reﬂex pathway comprises at least one afferent neuron (receptor) and one efferent (effector or excitor) neuron appropriately arranged in a series (Figure 2 1.5). The afferent neuron receives signal from a sensory organ and transmits the impulse via a dorsal nerve root into the CNS (at the level of spinal cord). The efferent nueuron then carries signals from CNS to the effector. The stimulus and response thus forms a reﬂex arc as shown below in the knee jerk reﬂex. You should carefully study Figure 2 1.5 to understand the mechanism of a knee jerk reﬂex.

It is a mature or ripened ovary, developed after fertilisation. If a fruit is formed without fertilisation of the ovary, it is called a parthenocarpic fruit. Generally, the fruit consists of a wall or pericarp and seeds. The pericarp may be dry or ﬂeshy. When pericarp is thick and ﬂeshy, it is differentiated into the outer epicarp, the middle mesocarp and the inner endocarp. Epicarp Mesocarp Seed Endocarp- (b) Figure 5.17 Parts of a fruit : (a) Mango (b) Coconut In mango and coconut, the fruit is known as a drupe (Figure 5.17).

physics/,"MOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE POINTS TO PONDER l. 3.1 3.2 The path length traversed by an object between two points is. in general, not the same as the magnitude of displacement. The displacement depends only on the end points: the path length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path. In one dimension. the two quantities are equal only if the object does not change its direction during the course of motion. In all other cases. the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement. In view of point I above. the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if the path length is equal to the magnitude of displacement. The origin and the positive direction of an axis are a matter of choice. You should first specify this choice before you assign signs to quantities like displacement. velocity and acceleration. If a particle is speeding up. acceleration is in the direction of velocity: if its speed is decreasing. acceleration is in the direction opposite to that of the velocity. This statement is independent of the choice of the origin and the axis. The sign of acceleration does not tell us whether the particle's speed is increasing or decreasing. The sign of acceleration (as mentioned in point 3) depends on the choice of the positive direction of the axis. For example. if the vertically upward direction is chosen to be the positive direction of the axis, the acceleration due to gravity is negative. If a particle is falling under gravity. this acceleration. though negative. results in increase in speed. For a particle thrown upward. the same negative acceleration [of gravity) results in decrease in speed. The zero velocity of a particle at any instant does not necessarily imply zero acceleration at that instant. A particle may be momentarily at rest and yet have non—zero acceleration. For example. a particle thrown up has zero velocity at its uppermost point but the acceleration at that instant continues to be the acceleration due to gravity. In the kinematic equations of motion [Eq. (3.1 1]]. the various quantities are algebraic, i.e. they may be positive or negative. The equations are applicable in all situations [for one dimensional motion with constant acceleration) provided the values of different quantities are substituted in the equations with proper signs. The definitions of instantaneous velocity and acceleration [Eqs. (3.3) and (3.5)] are exact and are always correct while the kinematic equations [Eq. [3. l 1]) are true only for motion in which the magnitude and the direction of acceleration are constant during the course of motion.

A farmer ploughing the field, a construction worker carrying bricks, a student studying for a competitive examination, an artist painting a beautiful landscape, all are said to be working. In physics, however, the word ‘Work’ covers a definite and precise meaning. Somebody who has the capacity to work for 14- 16 hours a day is said to have a large stamina or energy. We admire a long distance runner for her stamina or energy. Energy is thus our capacity to do work. In Physics too, the term ‘energy’ is related to work in this sense, but as said above the term ‘work’ itself is defined much more precisely. The word ‘power’ is used in everyday life with different shades of meaning. In karate or boxing we talk of ‘powerful’ punches. These are delivered at a great speed. This shade of meaning is close to the meaning of the word ‘power’ used in physics. We shall find that there is at best a loose correlation between the physical definitions and the physiological pictures these terms generate in our minds. The aim of this chapter is to develop an understanding of these three physical quantities. Before we proceed to this task, we need to develop a mathematical prerequisite, namely the scalar product of two vectors. 6.1.1 The Scalar Product We have learnt about vectors and their use in Chapter 4. Physical quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration, force etc. are vectors. We have also learnt how vectors are added or subtracted. We now need to know how vectors are multiplied. There are two ways of multiplying vectors which we shall come across : one way known as the scalar product gives a scalar from two vectors and the other known as the vector product produces a new vector from two vectors. We shall look at the vector product in Chapter 7. Here we take up the scalar product of two vectors. The scalar product or dot product of any two vectors A and B, denoted as A-B (read 2019-20"

physics/,"THERMODYNAMICS — POINTS TO PONDER 1. Temperature of a body is related to its average internal energi, not to the kinetic energy of motion of its centre of mass. A bullet ﬁred from a gun is not at a higher temperature because of its high speed. Equilibrium in thermodynamics refers to the situation when macroscopic variables describing the thermodynamic state of a system do not depend on time. Equilibrium of a system in mechanics means the net external force and torque on the system are zero. In a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, the microscopic constituents of a system are not in equilibrium (in the sense of mechanics). Heat capacity, in general, depends on the process the system goes through when heat is supplied. In isothermal quasi-static processes, heat is absorbed or given out by the system even though at every stage the gas has the same temperature as that of the surrounding reservoir. This is possible because of the inﬁnitesimal difference in temperature between the system and the reservoir. EXERCISES"
biology/,"220 BIOLOGY rich in an enzyme Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO), but lack PEPcase. Thus, the basic pathway that results in the formation of the sugars, the Calvin pathway, is common to the C3 and C 4 plants. Did you note that the Calvin pathway occurs in all the mesophyll cells of the C3 plants? In the C4 plants it does not take place in the mesophyll cells but does so only in the bundle sheath cells. 13.9 PHOTORESPIRATION Let us try and understand one more process that creates an important difference between C3 and C 4 plants — Photorespiration. To understand photorespiration we have to know a little bit more about the ﬁrst step of the Calvin pathway — the ﬁrst CO2 fixation step. This is the reaction where RuBP combines with CO2 to form 2 molecules of 3PGA, that is catalysed by RuBisCO. RuBisCO that is the most abundant enzyme in the world (Do you wonder why?) is characterised by the fact that its active site can bind to both CO2 and O2 — hence the name. Can you think how this could be possible? RuBisCO has a much greater affinity for CO2 when the C02: 02 is nearly equal. Imagine what would happen if this were not so! This binding is competitive. It is the relative concentration of O2 and CO2 that determines which of the two will bind to the enzyme. In C3 plants some 02 does bind to RuBisCO, and hence CO2 ﬁxation is decreased. Here the RuBP instead of being converted to 2 molecules of PGA binds with O2 to form one molecule of phosphoglycerate and phosphoglycolate (2 Carbon) in a pathway called photorespiration. In the photorespiratory pathway, there is neither synthesis of sugars, nor of ATP. Rather it results in the release of CO2 with the utilisation of ATP. In the photorespiratory pathway there is no synthesis of ATP or NADPH. The biological function of photorespiration is not known yet. In C 4 plants photorespiration does not occur. This is because they have a mechanism that increases the concentration of CO2 at the enzyme site. This takes place when the C 4 acid from the mesophyll is broken down in the bundle sheath cells to release CO2 — this results in increasing the intracellular concentration of C02. In turn, this ensures that the RuBisCO functions as a carboxylase minimising the oxygenase activity. Now that you know that the C 4 plants lack photorespiration, you probably can understand why productivity and yields are better in these plants. In addition these plants show tolerance to higher temperatures. Based on the above discussion can you compare plants showing the C3 and the C4 pathway?

In this case the contribution of the internal forces to the total torque on the system is zero, since the torque resulting from each action- reaction pair of forces is zero.

Eq. (7.28 b) is the generalisation of the single particle case of Eq. (7.23) to a system of particles. Note that when we have only one particle, there are no internal forces or torques. Eq.(7 .28 b) is the rotational analogue of (7.28 b) —:Fext (7-17) Note that like Eq.(7 .17), Eq.(7.28b) holds good for any system of particles, whether it is a rigid body or its individual particles have all kinds of internal motion. Conservation of angular momentum If text: 0, Eq. (7 .28b) reduces to d_L = 0 dt or L = constant. (7 .29a) Thus, if the total external torque on a system of particles is zero, then the total angular momentum of the system is conserved, i.e. remains constant. Eq. (7 .29a) is equivalent to three scalar equations, LX=K1, Ly =K2 and LZ=K3 (7.29 b) Here K1, K2 and K3 are constants; LX, Ly and L2 are the components of the total angular momentum vector L along the x,y and z axes respectively. The statement that the total angular momentum is conserved means that each of these three components is conserved. Eq. (7.29a) is the rotational analogue of Eq.

A point on the axis like P3 remains stationary). every particle of the body moves in a circle, which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has its centre on the axis.

The particle P2 moves in a circle of radius r2 and with centre C2 on the axis. This circle, too, lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis. Note that the circles described by P1 and P2 may lie in different planes; both these planes, however, are perpendicular to the fixed axis. For any particle on the axis like P3, r = 0. Any such particle remains stationary while the body rotates. This is expected since the axis of rotation is fixed.

physics/,"LAWS OF MOTION 97 always occur in pairs. Further, the mutual forces between two bodies are always equal and opposite. This idea was expressed by Newton in the form of the third law of motion. To every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction. Newton’s wording of the third law is so crisp and beautiful that it has become a part of common language. For the same reason perhaps, misconceptions about the third law abound. Let us note some important points about the third law, particularly in regard to the usage of the terms : action and reaction. 1. The terms action and reaction in the third law mean nothing else but ‘force’. Using different terms for the same physical concept can sometimes be confusing. A simple and clear way of stating the third law is as follows: Forces always occur in pairs. Force on a body A by B is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A. 2. The terms action and reaction in the third law may give a wrong impression that action reﬂecting telescope. Isaac Newton (1 642 - 1 72 7) Isaac Newton was born in Woolsthorpe, England in 1642. the year Galileo died. His extraordinary mathematical ability and mechanical aptitude remained hidden from others in his school life. In 1662. he went to Cambridge for undergraduate studies. A plague epidemic in 1665 forced the university town to close and Newton had to return to his mother's farm. There in two years of solitude, his dormant creativity blossomed in a deluge of fundamental discoveries in mathematics and physics : binomial theorem for negative and fractional exponents. the beginning of calculus. the inverse square law of gravitation. the spectrum of white light. and so on. Returning to Cambridge. he pursued his investigations in optics and devised a In 1684. encouraged by his friend Edmund Halley. Newton embarked on writing what was to be one of the greatest scientiﬁc works ever published : The Principia Mathematica. In it. he enunciated the three laws of motion and the universal law of gravitation. which explained all the three Kepler's laws of planetary motion. The book was packed with a host of path—breaking achievements : basic principles of ﬂuid mechanics. mathematics of wave motion, calculation of masses of the earth. the sun and other planets, explanation of the precession of equinoxes. theory of tides, etc. In 1704, Newton brought out another masterpiece Opticks that summarized his work on light and colour. The scientific revolution triggered by Copernicus and steered vigorously ahead by Kepler and Galileo was brought to a grand completion by Newton. Newtonian mechanics uniﬁed terrestrial and celestial phenomena. The same mathematical equation governed the fall of an apple to the ground and the motion of the moon around the earth. The age of reason had dawned. comes before reaction i.e action is the cause and reaction the effect. There is no cause- effect relation implied in the third law. The force on A by B and the force on B by A act at the same instant. By the same reasoning, any one of them may be called action and the other reaction. 3. Action and reaction forces act on different bodies, not on the same body. Consider a pair of bodies A and B. According to the third law, F = — FBA (5.8) AB (force on A by B) = — (force on B by A) Thus if we are considering the motion of any one body (A or B), only one of the two forces is relevant. It is an error to add up the two forces and claim that the net force is zero. However, if you are considering the system of two bodies as a whole, F AB and FBA are internal forces of the system (A + B). They add up to give a null force. Internal forces in a body or a system of particles thus cancel away in pairs. This is an important fact that enables the second law to be applicable to a body or a system of particles (See Chapter 7). 2019-20"

FSH stimulates growth and development of the ovarian follicles in females. MSH acts on the melanocytes (melanin containing cells) and regulates pigmentation of the skin. Oxytocin acts on the smooth muscles of our body and stimulates their contraction. In females, it stimulates a vigorous contraction of uterus at the time of child birth, and milk ejection from the mammary gland. Vasopressin acts mainly at the kidney and stimulates resorption of water and electrolytes by the distal tubules and thereby reduces loss of water through urine (diuresis). Hence, it is also called as anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). An impairment affecting synthesis or release of ADH results in a diminished ability of the kidney to conserve water leading to water loss and dehydration. This condition is known as Diabetes Insipidus. 22.2.3 The Pineal Gland The pineal gland is located on the dorsal side of forebrain. Pineal secretes a hormone called melatonin. Melatonin plays a very important role in the regulation of a 24-hour (diurnal) rhythm of our body. For example, it helps in maintaining the normal rhythms of sleep-wake cycle, body temperature.

This is why this acceleration is called centripetal acceleration (a term proposed by Newton).

Since 1) and R are constant, the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is also constant. However, the direction changes — pointing always towards the centre. Therefore, a centripetal acceleration is not a constant vector. We have another way of describing the velocity and the acceleration of an object in uniform circular motion. As the object moves from P to P’ in time At (= t’ — t), the line CP (Fig. 4.19) turns through an angle A0 as shown in the figure. A0 is called angular distance. We define the angular speed a) (Greek letter omega) as the time rate of change of angular displacement : w: _ At (4.45) Now, if the distance travelled by the object during the time At is As, i.e. PP’is As, then : As v = — At but As = R A6.

biology/,"284 BIOLOGY pulmonary artery and the aorta respectively are provided with the semilunar valves. The valves in the heart allows the ﬂow of blood only in one direction, i.e., from the atria to the ventricles and from the ventricles to the pulmonary artery or aorta. These valves prevent any backward ﬂow. The entire heart is made of cardiac muscles. The walls of ventricles are much thicker than that of the atria. A specialised cardiac musculature called the nodal tissue is also distributed in the heart (Figure 18.2). A patch of this tissue is present in the right upper corner of the right atrium called the sino—atrial node (SAN). Another mass of this tissue is seen in the lower left corner of the right atrium close to the atrio—ventricular septum called the atria-ventricular node (AVN). A bundle of nodal ﬁbres, atrio- ventricular bundle (AV bundle) continues from the AVN which passes through the atrio-ventricular septa to emerge on the top of the inter- ventricular septum and immediately divides into a right and left bundle. These branches give rise to minute ﬁbres throughout the ventricular musculature of the respective sides and are called purkinje ﬁbres. The nodal musculature has the ability to generate action potentials without any external stimuli, i.e., it is autoexcitable. However, the number of action potentials that could be generated in a minute vary at different parts of the nodal system. The SAN can generate the maximum number of action potentials, i.e., 7 0-7 5 min—1, and is responsible for initiating and maintaining the rhythmic contractile activity of the heart. Therefore, it is called the pacemaker. Our heart normally beats 7 O- 75 times in a minute (average 72 beats min—1). 18.3.2 Cardiac Cycle How does the heart function? Let us take a look. To begin with, all the four chambers of heart are in a relaxed state, i.e., they are in joint diastole. As the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are open, blood from the pulmonary veins and vena cava ﬂows into the left and the right ventricle respectively through the left and right atria. The semilunar valves are closed at this stage. The SAN now generates an action potential which stimulates both the atria to undergo a simultaneous contraction — the atrial systole. This increases the ﬂow of blood into the ventricles by about 30 per cent. The action potential is conducted to the ventricular side by the AVN and AV bundle from where the bundle of His transmits it through the entire ventricular musculature. This causes the ventricular muscles to contract, (ventricular systole), the atria undergoes relaxation (diastole), coinciding with the ventricular systole. Ventricular systole increases the ventricular pressure causing the closure of tricuspid and"

Monera, Protista, Fungi, Animalia and Plantae. In this chapter, we will deal in detail with further classiﬁcation within Kingdom Plantae popularly known as the ‘plant kingdom’. We must stress here that our understanding of the plant kingdom has changed over time. Fungi, and members of the Monera and Protista having cell walls have now been excluded from Plantae though earlier classiﬁcations placed them in the same kingdom. So, the cyanobacteria that are also referred to as blue green algae are not ‘algae’ any more. In this chapter, we will describe Algae, Bryophytes, Pteridophytes, Gymnosperms and Angiosperms under Plantae . Let us also look at classification within angiosperms to understand some of the concerns that inﬂuenced the classiﬁcation systems. The earliest systems of classiﬁcation used only gross superﬁcial morphological characters such as habit, colour, number and shape of leaves, etc. They were based mainly on vegetative characters or on the androecium structure (system given by Linnaeus). Such systems were artiﬁcial; they separated the closely related species since they were based on a few characteristics. Also, the artiﬁcial systems gave equal weightage to vegetative and sexual characteristics; this is not acceptable since we know that often the vegetative characters are more easily affected by environment. As against this, natural classification systems developed, which were based on natural afﬁnities among the organisms and consider, 2019-2020"

Such an error by definition is of clerical nature and most of the errors of commission affect in the trial balance. 6.4.3 Errors of Omission The errors of omission may be committed at the time of recording the transaction in the books of original entry or while posting to the ledger. These can be of two types: (i) error of complete omission (ii) error of partial omission When a transaction is completely omitted from recording in the books of original record, it is an error of complete omission. For example, credit sales to Mohan ? 10,000, not entered in the sales book. When the recording of transaction is partly omitted from the books, it is an error of partial omission. If in the above example, credit sales had been duly recorded in the sales book but the posting from sales book to Mohan’s account has not been made, it would be an error of partial omission. 6.4.4 Errors of Principle Accounting entries are recorded as per the generally accepted accounting principles. If any of these principles are violated or ignored, errors resulting from such Violation are known as errors of principle. An error of principle may occur due to incorrect classiﬁcation of expenditure or receipt between capital and revenue. This is very important because it will have an impact on financial statements. It may lead to under/ over stating of income or assets or liabilities, etc. For example, amount spent on additions to the buildings should be treated as capital expenditure and must be debited to the asset account. Instead, if this amount is debited to maintenance and repairs account, it has been treated as a revenue expense. This is an error of principle. Similarly, if a credit purchase of machinery is recorded in purchases book instead of j ournal proper or rent paid to the landlord is recorded in the cash book as payment to landlord, these errors of principle. These errors do not affect the trial balance. 6.4.5 Compensating Errors When two or more errors are committed in such a way that the net effect of these errors on the debits and credits of accounts is nil, such errors are called compensating errors. Such errors do not affect the tallying of the trial balance.

physics/,"358 PHYSICS d2X dx mdt2 +bdt +kx— Focos codt (14.37b) This is the equation of an oscillator of mass m on which a periodic force of (angular) frequency cod is applied. The oscillator, initially, oscillates with its natural frequency a). When we apply the external periodic force, the oscillations with the natural frequency die out, and then the body oscillates with the (angular) frequency of the external periodic force. Its displacement, after the natural oscillations die out, is given by x(t) = Acos (wdt + ¢) (14.38) where tis the time measured from the moment when we apply the periodic force. The amplitude A is a function of the forced frequency cod and the natural frequency (0. Analysis shows that it is given by FD A _ 2 1/2 {m2 (wz —(031) + aﬁbz} (14.393) and tan (1) = —v0 (14.39b) wdxo where m is the mass of the particle and v0 and x0 are the velocity and the displacement of the particle at time t = 0, which is the moment when we apply the periodic force. Equation (14.39) shows that the amplitude of the forced oscillator depends on the (angular) frequency of the driving force. We can see a different behaviour of the oscillator when cod is far from a) and when it is close to a). We consider these two cases. (a) Small Damping, Driving Frequency far from Natural Frequency : In this case, cod b will be much smaller than m(w2 —a):), and we can neglect that term. Then Eq. (14.39) reduces to F A = —O (14.40) m(w2—a)f,) Fig. 14.21 shows the dependence of the displacement amplitude of an oscillator on the angular frequency of the driving force for different amounts of damping present in the system. It may be noted that in all cases the amplitude is the greatest when cod /w = 1. The curves in this figure show that smaller the damping, the taller and narrower is the resonance peak. 2019-20 b=50g 5 (least Amplitude 0.6 0.8 1.0 1 .2 1 .4 cod/w Fig. 14.21 The displacement amplitude of a forced oscillator as a function of the angular frequency of the driving force.

The curves 1 and 3 correspond to minimum and maximum damping in the system. If we go on changing the driving frequency, the amplitude tends to infinity when it equals the natural frequency. But this is the ideal case of zero damping, a case which never arises in a real system as the damping is never perfectly zero. You must have experienced in a swing that when the timing of your push exactly matches with the time period of the swing, your swing gets the maximum amplitude. This amplitude is large, but not infinity, because there is always some damping in your swing. This will become clear in the (b). (b) Driving Frequency Close to Natural Frequency : If cod is very close to a), m ((02—503) would be much less than cod b, for any reasonable value of b, then Eq.

The phenomenon of increase in amplitude when the driving force is close to the natural frequency of the oscillator is called resonance.

We restricted ourselves to simpler situations of rigid bodies. A rigid body generally means a hard solid object having a definite shape and size. But in reality, bodies can be stretched, compressed and bent. Even the appreciably rigid steel bar can be deformed when a sufficiently large external force is applied on it. This means that solid bodies are not perfectly rigid. A solid has definite shape and size. In order to change (or deform) the shape or size of a body, a force is required. If you stretch a helical spring by gently pulling its ends, the length of the spring increases slightly. When you leave the ends of the spring, it regains its original size and shape. The property of a body, by virtue of which it tends to regain its original size and shape when the applied force is removed, is known as elasticity and the deformation caused is known as elastic deformation. However, if you apply force to a lump of putty or mud, they have no gross tendency to regain their previous shape, and they get permanently deformed. Such substances are called plastic and this property is called plasticity. Putty and mud are close to ideal plastics. The elastic behaviour of materials plays an important role in engineering design. For example, while designing a building, knowledge of elastic properties of materials like steel, concrete etc. is essential. The same is true in the design of bridges, automobiles, ropeways etc. One could also ask — Can we design an aeroplane which is very light but sufficiently strong? Can we design an artificial limb which is lighter but stronger? Why does a railway track have a particular shape like I? Why is glass brittle while brass is not? Answers to such questions begin with the study of how relatively simple kinds of loads or forces act to deform different solids bodies. In this chapter, we shall study the 2019-20"

The buccal cavity performs two major functions, mastication of food and facilitation of swallowing. The teeth and the tongue with the help of saliva masticate and mix up the food thoroughly. Mucus in saliva helps in lubricating and adhering the masticated food particles into a bolus. ’Ihe bolus is then conveyed into the pharynx and then into the oesophagus by swallowing or deglutition. The bolus further passes down through the oesophagus by successive waves of muscular contractions called peristalsis. The gastro-oesophageal sphincter controls the passage of food into the stomach.The saliva secreted into the oral cavity contains electrolytes (Na"", K*, CI', H005) and enzymes, salivary amylase and lysozyme. The chemical process of digestion is initiated in the oral cavity by the hydrolytic action of the carbohydrate splitting enzyme, the salivary"
biology/,"THE LIVING WORLD organism in various categories? The basic requirement is the knowledge of characters of an individual or group of organisms. This helps in identifying similarities and dissimilarities among the individuals of the same kind of organisms as well as of other kinds of organisms. 1 .3. 1 Species Taxonomic studies consider a group of individual organisms with fundamental similarities as a species. One should be able to distinguish one species from the other closely related species based on the distinct morphological differences. Let us consider Mangifera indica, Solanum tuberosum (potato) and Panthera leo (lion). All the three names, indica, tuberosum and leo, represent the speciﬁc epithets, while the ﬁrst words Mangifera, Solanum and Panthera are genera and represents another higher level of taxon or category. Each genus may have one or more than one speciﬁc epithets representing different organisms, but having morphological similarities. For example, Panthera has another speciﬁc epithet called tigris and Solanum includes species like nigrum and melongena. Human beings belong to the species sapiens which is grouped in the genus Homo. The scientiﬁc name thus, for human being, is written as Homo sapiens. 1.3.2 Genus Genus comprises a group of related species which has more characters in common in comparison to species of other genera. We can say that genera are aggregates of closely related species. For example, potato and brinjal are two different species but both belong to the genus Solanum Lion (Panthera leo), leopard (P. pardus) and tiger (P. tigris) with several common features, are all species of the genus Panthera. This genus differs from another genus Felis which includes cats. 1 .3.3 Family The next category, Family, has a group of related genera with still less number of similarities as compared to genus and species. Families are characterised on the basis of both vegetative and reproductive features of plant species. Among plants for example, three different genera Solanum, Petunia and Datura are placed in the family Solanaceae. Among animals for example, genus Panthera, comprising lion, tiger, leopard is put along with genus, Felis (cats) in the family Felidae. Similarly, if you observe the features of a cat and a dog, you will ﬁnd some similarities and some differences as well. They are separated into two different families — Felidae and Canidae, respectively."
physics/,"LAWS OF MOTION 93 The property of inertia contained in the First law is evident in many situations. Suppose we are standing in a stationary bus and the driver starts the bus suddenly. We get thrown backward with a jerk. Why ? Our feet are in touch with the ﬂoor. If there were no friction, we would remain where we were, while the ﬂoor of the bus would simply slip forward under our feet and the back of the bus would hit us. However, fortunately, there is some friction between the feet and the ﬂoor. If the start is not too sudden, i.e. if the acceleration is moderate, the frictional force would be enough to accelerate our feet along with the bus. But our body is not strictly a rigid body. It is deformable, i.e. it allows some relative displacement between different parts. What this means is that while our feet go with the bus, the rest of the body remains where it is due to inertia. Relative to the bus, therefore, we are thrown backward. As soon as that happens, however, the muscular forces on the rest of the body (by the feet) come into play to move the body along with the bus. A similar thing happens when the bus suddenly stops. Our feet stop due to the friction which does not allow relative motion between the feet and the ﬂoor of the bus. But the rest of the body continues to move forward due to inertia. We are thrown forward. The restoring muscular forces again come into play and bring the body to rest. ’ Example 5.1 An astronaut accidentally gets separated out of his small spaceship accelerating in inter stellar space at a constant rate of 100 m 5’2. What is the acceleration of the astronaut the instant after he is outside the spaceship ? (Assume that there are no nearby stars to exert gravitational force on him.) Answer Since there are no nearby stars to exert gravitational force on him and the small spaceship exerts negligible gravitational attraction on him, the net force acting on the astronaut, once he is out of the spaceship, is zero. By the first law of motion the acceleration of the astronaut is zero. 4 5.5 NEWTON’S SECOND LAW OF MOTION The first law refers to the simple case when the net external force on a body is zero. The second law of motion refers to the general situation when there is a net external force acting on the body. It relates the net external force to the acceleration of the body. Momentum Momentum of a body is deﬁned to be the product of its mass m and velocity v, and is denoted by p: p = mv (5.1) Momentum is clearly a vector quantity. The following common experiences indicate the importance of this quantity for considering the effect of force on motion. 0 Suppose a light-weight vehicle (say a small car) and a heavy weight vehicle (say a loaded truck) are parked on a horizontal road. We all know that a much greater force is needed to push the truck than the car to bring them to the same speed in same time. Similarly, a greater opposing force is needed to stop a heavy body than a light body in the same time, if they are moving with the same speed. 0 If two stones, one light and the other heavy, are dropped from the top of a building, a person on the gound will find it easier to catch the light stone than the heavy stone. The mass of a body is thus an important parameter that determines the effect of force on its motion. ' Speed is another important parameter to consider. A bullet ﬁred by a gun can easily pierce human tissue before it stops, resulting in casualty. The same bullet fired with moderate speed will not cause much damage. Thus for a given mass, the greater the speed, the greater is the opposing force needed to stop the body in a certain time. Taken together, the product of mass and velocity, that is momentum, is evidently a relevant variable of motion. The greater the change in the momentum in a given time, the greater is the force that needs to be applied. ' A seasoned cricketer catches a cricket ball coming in with great speed far more easily than a novice, who can hurt his hands in the act. One reason is that the cricketer allows a longer time for his hands to stop the ball. As you may have noticed, he draws in the hands backward in the act of catching the ball (Fig. 5.3). The novice, on the other hand, keeps his hands fixed and tries to catch the ball almost instantly. He needs to provide a much greater force to stop the ball instantly, and 2019-20"
biology/,"CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE You may recall that the interphase nucleus has a loose and indistinct network of nucleoprotein ﬁbres called chromatin. But during different stages of cell division, cells show structured chromosomes in place of the nucleus. Chromatin contains DNA and some basic proteins called histones, some non-histone proteins and also RNA. A single human cell has approximately two metre long thread of DNA distributed among its forty six (twenty three pairs) chromosomes. You will study the details of DNA packaging in the form of a chromosome in class XII. Every chromosome (visible only in dividing cells) essentially has a primary constriction or the centromere on the sides of which disc shaped structures called kinetochores are present Wigure 8. 12). Centromere holds two chromatids of a chromosome. Based on the position of the centromere, the chromosomes can be classiﬁed into four types (Figure 8.13). The metacentric chromosome has middle centromere forming two equal arms of the chromosome. The sub-metacentric chromosome has centromere slightly away from the middle of the chromosome resulting into one shorter arm and one longer arm.

Each ‘F’ actin is a polymer of monomeric ‘G’ (Globular) actins. Two ﬁlaments of another protein, tropomyosin also run close to the ‘F’ actins throughout its length. A complex protein Troponin is distributed at regular intervals on the tropomyosin. In the resting state a subunit of troponin masks the active binding sites for myosin on the actin ﬁlaments (Figure 20.3a). Each myosin (thick) ﬁlament is also a polymerised protein. Many monomeric proteins called Meromyosins (Figure 20.3b) constitute one thick ﬁlament. Each meromyosin has two important parts, a globular head with a short arm and a tail, the former being called the heavy meromyosin HMM) and the latter, the ﬁght meromyosin ﬂ.MM). The HMM component, i.e.; the head and short arm projects outwards at regular distance and angle from each other from the surface of a polymerised myosin ﬁlament and is known as cross arm.

biology/,"BIOIDGICAL CLASSIFICATION Viroids : In 197 1, T.O. Diener discovered a new infectious agent that was smaller than viruses and caused potato spindle tuber disease. It was found to be a free RNA; it lacked the protein coat that is found in viruses, hence the name viroid. The RNA of the viroid was of low molecular weight. Prions : In modern medicine certain infectious neurological diseases were found to be transmitted by an agent consisting of abnormally folded protein. The agent was similar in size to viruses. These agents were called prions. The most notable diseases caused by prions are bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) commonly called mad cow disease in cattle and its analogous variant Cr—Jacob disease (CJD) in humans. Lichens : Lichens are symbiotic associations i.e. mutually useful associations, between algae and fungi. The algal component is known as phycobiont and fungal component as mycobiont, which are autotrophic and heterotrophic, respectively. Algae prepare food for fungi and fungi provide shelter and absorb mineral nutrients and water for its partner. So close is their association that if one saw a lichen in nature one would never imagine that they had two different organisms within them. Lichens are very good pollution indicators — they do not grow in polluted areas. SUMMARY Biological classiﬁcation of plants and animals was ﬁrst proposed by Aristotle on the basis of simple morphological characters. Linnaeus later classiﬁed all living organisms into two kingdoms — Plantae and Animalia. Whittaker proposed an elaborate ﬁve kingdom classiﬁcation — Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia. The main criteria of the ﬁve kingdom classiﬁcation were cell structure, body organisation, mode of nutrition and reproduction, and phylogenetic relationships. In the ﬁve kingdom classiﬁcation, bacteria are included in Kingdom Monera. Bacteria are cosmopolitan in distribution. These organisms show the most extensive metabolic diversity. Bacteria may be autotrophic or heterotrophic in their mode of nutrition. Kingdom Protista includes all single-celled eukaryotes such as Chrysophytes, Dinoﬂagellates, Euglenoids, Slime-moulds and Protozoans. Protists have deﬁned nucleus and other membrane bound organelles. They reproduce both asexually and sexually. Members of Kingdom Fungi show a great diversity in structures and habitat. Most fungi are saprophytic in their mode of nutrition. They show asexual and sexual reproduction. Phycomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes are the four classes under this kingdom. The plantae includes all eukaryotic chlorophyll-containing organisms. Algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms are included in this group. The life cycle of plants exhibit alternation of generations — gametophytic and sporophytic generations. The heterotrophic eukaryotic, multicellular organisms lacking a cell wall are included in the Kingdom Animalia. The mode of nutrition of these organisms is holozoic. They reproduce mostly by the sexual mode. Some acellular organisms like viruses and viroids as well as the lichens are not included in the ﬁve kingdom system of classiﬁcation. 27"

Thus. motion repeats itself after nT where n is an integer. Every periodic motion is not simple hamionic motion. Only that periodic motion governed by the force law F = — kx is simple harmonic. Circular motion can arise due to an inverse~square law force (as in planetary motion) as well as due to simple harmonic force in two dimensions equal to: —mar”r. In the latter case. the phases of motion, in two perpendicular directions (x and y] must differ by TE/2. Thus. for example, a particle subject to a force —m(02r with initial position (0. A) and velocity [coA. 0) will move uniformly in a circle of radius A. For linear simple harmonic motion with a given a). two initial conditions are necessary and sufficient to determine the motion completely. The initial conditions may be (i) initial position and initial velocity or (ii) amplitude and phase or (iii) energy and phase. 2019-20"

Further, EH = Eh which implies, v121= 29(H— h) (6.11 d) and is a familiar result from kinematics. At the height H, the energy is purely potential. It is partially converted to kinetic at height h and is fully kinetic at ground level. This illustrates the conservation of mechanical energy. b Example 6.7 Abob of mass mis suspended by a light string of length L.

Comment on the nature of the trajectory of the bob after it reaches the point C. 2019-20 Answer (i) There are two external forces on the bob : gravity and the tension (T) in the string. The latter does no work since the displacement of the bob is always normal to the string. The potential energy of the bob is thus associated with the gravitational force only. The total mechanical energy E of the system is conserved. We take the potential energy of the system to be zero at the lowest point A. Thus, at A : 1 E = Emvg (6.12) 2 ml) TA — mg = L0 [Newton’s Second Law] where TA is the tension in the string at A.

Thus every measurement is approximate due to errors in measurement. In general, the errors in measurement can be broadly classified as (a) systematic errors and (b) random errors. Systematic errors The systematic errors are those errors that tend to be in one direction, either positive or negative. Some of the sources of systematic errors are : (a) Instrumental errors that arise from the errors due to imperfect design or calibration of the measuring instrument, zero error in the instrument, etc. For example, the temperature graduations of a thermometer may be inadequately calibrated (it may read 104 °C at the boiling point of water at STP whereas it should read 100 °C); in a vernier callipers the zero mark of vernier scale may not coincide with the zero mark of the main scale, or simply an ordinary metre scale may be worn off at one end. (b) Imperfection in experimental technique or procedure To determine the temperature of a human body, a thermometer placed under the armpit will always give a temperature lower than the actual value of the body temperature. Other external conditions (such as changes in temperature, humidity, wind velocity, etc.) during the experiment may systematically affect the measurement. (c) Personal errors that arise due to an individual’s bias, lack of proper setting of the apparatus or individual’s carelessness in taking observations without observing proper precautions, etc. For example, if you, by habit, always hold your head a bit too far to the right while reading the position of a needle on the scale, you will introduce an error due to parallax. Systematic errors can be minimised by improving experimental techniques, selecting better instruments and removing personal bias as far as possible. For a given set-up, these errors may be estimated to a certain extent and the necessary corrections may be applied to the readings. Random errors The random errors are those errors, which occur irregularly and hence are random with respect 2019-20"

This means that there is a pressure difference between the two sides of the top surface. This is given by (P.- — Pa) =(2S/ r) = 2S/(a sec 6) = (2S/a) cos 0 (10.29) Thus the pressure of the water inside the tube, just at the meniscus (air—water interface) is less than the atmospheric pressure. Consider the two points A and B in Fig. 10.21(a). They must be at the same pressure, namely P0+ hpg=Pi=PA (10.30) where p is the density of water and h is called the capillary rise [Fig. 10.2 1(a)]. Using Eq. (10.29) and (10.30) we have hpg=(Pi—P0)=(2Scos0)/a (10.31) The discussion here, and the Eqs. (10.26) and (10.27) make it clear that the capillary rise is due to surface tension. It is larger, for a smaller a. Typically it is of the order of a few cm for fine capillaries. For example, if a = 0.05 cm, using the value of surface tension for water (Table 10.3), we find that h=2S/(pga) = 2X(0.073 N m'l) (103 kgm'3) (9.8 ms'2)(5 X 10'4 m) = 2.98 x 10‘2 m = 2.98 cm Notice that if the liquid meniscus is convex, as for mercury, i.e., if cos 0 is negative then from Eq. (1 0.30) for example, it is clear that the liquid will be lower in the capillary ! 10.6.6 Detergents and Surface Tension We clean dirty clothes containing grease and oil stains sticking to cotton or other fabrics by adding detergents or soap to water, soaking clothes in it and shaking. Let us understand this process better. Washing with water does not remove grease stains. This is because water does not wet greasy dirt; i.e., there is very little area of contact between them. If water could wet grease, the ﬂow of water could carry some grease away. Something of this sort is achieved through detergents. The molecules of detergents are hairpin shaped, with one end attracted to water and the other to molecules of grease, oil or wax, thus tending to form water-oil interfaces. The result is shown in Fig. 10.22 as a sequence of ﬁgures. In our language, we would say that addition of detergents, whose molecules attract at one end and say, oil on the other, reduces drastically the surface tension S (water-oil). It may even become energetically favourable to form such interfaces, i.e., globs of dirt surrounded by detergents and then by water. This kind of process using surface active detergents or surfactants is important not only for cleaning, but also in recovering oil, mineral ores etc. Soap molecules Detergent is added, the 'inert' waxy ends of its molecules are attracted to boundary where water meets dirt. Inert ends surround dirt and the platter dirt can now be dislodged say by moving water.

physics/,"OSCILLATIONS 357 Of course, as expected, if we put b = 0, all equations of a damped oscillator in this section reduce to the corresponding equations of an undamped oscillator. Example 14.10 For the damped oscillator shown in Fig. 14.19. the mass m of the block is 200 g. k = 90 N m‘1 and the damping constant b is 40 g 5’1. Calculate (a) the period of oscillation. (b) time taken for its amplitude of vibrations to drop to half of its initial value. and (c) the time taken for its mechanical energy to drop to half its initial value. Answer (a) We see that km = 90X0.2 = 18 kg N m‘1 = kg2 S'2; therefore . (km = 4.243 kg 8'1, and b = 0.04 kg S'l. Therefore, b is much less than . (km . Hence, the time period Tfrom Eq. (14.34) is given by T227: 3 Vk Zzﬂlﬂ QONmT1 = 0.3s (b) Now, from Eq. (14.33), the time, T for the 1/2’ amplitude to drop to half of its initial value is given by, _ ln(1/2) _ b/2m 1/2 = 0693 x 2 x 200 s 40 = 6.93 s (c) For calculating the time, t1/2, for its mechanical energy to drop to half its initial value we make use of Eq. (14.35). From this equation we have, E(t )/E(O) = exp (—bt1/2/m) 1/2 Or 1/2 = exp (—bt /m) 1/2 ln(1/2) = -(bt /m) 1/2 Or t1/2 2%x200g = 3.46 s This is just half of the decay period for amplitude. This is not surprising, because, according to Eqs. (14.33) and (14.35), energy depends on the square of the amplitude. Notice that there is a factor of 2 in the exponents of the two exponentials. 4 14. 10 FORCED OSCILLATIONS AND RESONANCE When a system (such as a simple pendulum or a block attached to a spring) is displaced from its equilibrium position and released, it oscillates with its natural frequency w, and the oscillations are called free oscillations. All free oscillations eventually die out because of the ever present damping forces. However, an external agency can maintain these oscillations. These are called forced or driven oscillations. We consider the case when the external force is itself periodic, with a frequency cod called the driven frequency. The most important fact of forced periodic oscillations is that the system oscillates not with its natural frequency a), but at the frequency cod of the external agency; the free oscillations die out due to damping. The most familiar example of forced oscillation is when a child in a garden swing periodically presses his feet against the ground (or someone else periodically gives the child a push) to maintain the oscillations. Suppose an external force Ht) of amplitude F0 that varies periodically with time is applied to a damped oscillator. Such a force can be represented as, F(t) = F0 cos wdt (14.36) The motion of a particle under the combined action of a linear restoring force, damping force and a time dependent driving force represented by Eq. (14.36) is given by, ma(t) =—kx(t) — bv(t) +F0 cos wdt (14.37a) Substituting d2x/dt2 for acceleration in Eq. (14.37a) and rearranging it, we get 2019-20"
physics/,"46 PHYSICS that the acceleration is nonuniform over the period 0 s to 10 s. It is zero between 10 s and 18 s and is constant with value —12 m S'2 between 18 s and 20 s. When the acceleration is uniform, obviously, it equals the average acceleration over that period. Since velocity is a quantity having both magnitude and direction, a change in velocity may involve either or both of these factors. Acceleration, therefore, may result from a change in speed (magnitude), a change in direction or changes in both. Like velocity, acceleration can also be positive, negative or zero. Position-time graphs for motion with positive, negative and zero acceleration are shown in Figs. 3.9 (a), (b) and (c), respectively. Note that the graph curves upward for positive acceleration; downward for negative acceleration and it is a straight line for zero acceleration. As an exercise, identify in Fig. 3.3, the regions of the curve that correspond to these three cases. Although acceleration can vary with time, our study in this chapter will be restricted to motion with constant acceleration. In this case, the average acceleration equals the constant value of acceleration during the interval. If the velocity of an object is v at t= O and v at time t, we have 0 a_v—v0 or v-v +at (36) _ t — 0 ’ _ 0 ' T Positive a T Negative a T a= 0 x X 0 t—> 0 t—’ (a) (b) Fig. 3.9 Position—time graph for motion with (a) positive acceleration; (b) negative acceleration, and (c) zero acceleration. Let us see how velocity-time graph looks like for some simple cases. Fig. 3.10 shows velocity- time graph for motion with constant acceleration for the following cases : (a) An object is moving in a positive direction with a positive acceleration, for example the motion of the car in Fig. 3.3 between t= O sand t= 10 s. 2019-20 (b) An object is moving in positive direction with a negative acceleration, for example, motion of the car in Fig 3.3 between 1:: 18 s and 20 s. (c) An object is moving in negative direction with a negative acceleration, for example the motion of a car moving from O in Fig. 3.1 in negative x-direction with increasing speed. (d) An object is moving in positive direction till time t1, and then turns back with the same negative acceleration, for example the motion of a car from point 0 to point Q in Fig. 3.1 till time t1 with decreasing speed and turning back and moving with the same negative acceleration. An interesting feature of a velocity-time graph for any moving object is that the area under the curve represents the displacement over a given time interval. A general proof of this (d) Fig. 3.10 Velocity—time graph for motions with constant acceleration (a) Motion in positive direction with positive acceleration, (b) Motion in positive direction with negative acceleration, (c) Motion in negative direction with negative acceleration, (d) Motion of an object with negative acceleration that changes direction at time t1.

Let us study the pathway by listing the steps. The primary CO2 acceptor is a 3-carbon molecule phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) and is present in the mesophyll cells. The enzyme responsible for this ﬁxation is PEP carboxylase or PEPcase. It is important to register that the mesophyll cells lack RuBisCO enzyme. The C 4 acid OAA is formed in the mesophyll cells. It then forms other 4—carbon compounds like malic acid or aspartic acid in the mesophyll cells itself, which are transported to the bundle sheath cells. In the bundle sheath cells these C 4 acids are broken down to release CO2 and a 3-carbon molecule. The 3-carbon molecule is transported back to the mesophyll where it is converted to PEP again, thus, completing the cycle. The CO2 released in the bundle sheath cells enters the C3 or the Calvin pathway, a pathway common to all plants.

The wider part of the meter has a cross- sectional area equal to that of the artery. A = 8 mm2. The narrower part has an area a = 4 mmz. The pressure drop in the artery is 24 Pa. What is the speed of the blood in the artery? Answer We take the density of blood from Table 10.1 to be 1.06 x 103 kg m‘3. The ratio of the A areas is (a) = 2. Using Eq. (10.17) we obtain v = & =0 123ms'1 1 1060kg m-3x(22— 1) ' 10.4.3 Blood Flow and Heart Attack Bernoulli’s principle helps in explaining blood ﬂow in artery. The artery may get constricted due to the accumulation of plaque on its inner walls. In order to drive the blood through this constriction a greater demand is placed on the activity of the heart. The speed of the ﬂow of the blood in this region is raised which lowers the pressure inside and the artery may collapse due to the external pressure. The heart exerts further pressure to open this artery and forces the blood through. As the blood rushes through the opening, the internal pressure once again drops clue to same reasons leading to a repeat collapse. This may result in heart attack. l) [a] 10.4.4 Dynamic Lift Dynamic lift is the force that acts on a body, such as airplane wing, a hydrofoil or a spinning ball, by virtue of its motion through a ﬂuid. In many games such as cricket, tennis, baseball, or golf, we notice that a spinning ball deviates from its parabolic trajectory as it moves through air. This deviation can be partly explained on the basis of Bernoulli’s principle. (i) Ball moving without spin: Fig. 10.13(a) shows the streamlines around a non-spinning ball moving relative to a ﬂuid. From the symmetry of streamlines it is clear that the velocity of ﬂuid (air) above and below the ball at corresponding points is the same resulting in zero pressure difference. The air therefore, exerts no upward or downward force on the ball. (ii) Ball moving with spin: A ball which is spinning drags air along with it. If the surface is rough more air will be dragged. Fig 10.13(b) shows the streamlines of air for a ball which is moving and spinning at the same time. The ball is moving forward and relative to it the air is moving backwards. Therefore, the velocity of air above the ball relative to the ball is larger and below it is smaller (see Section 10.3). The stream lines, thus, get crowded above and rarified below. This difference in the velocities of air results in the pressure difference between the lower and upper faces and there is a net upward force on the ball. This dynamic lift clue to spining is called Magnus effect. Fig 1 O. 1 3 (a) Fluid streaming past a static sphere. (b) Streamlines for a ﬂuid around a sphere spinning clockwise.

The ascending limb continues as another highly coiled tubular region called distal convoluted tubule 030T). The DCTs of many nephrons open into a straight tube called collecting duct, many of which converge and open into the renal pelvis through medullary pyramids in the calyces. The Malpighian corpuscle, PCT and DOT of the nephron are situated in the cortical region of the kidney whereas the loop of Henle dips into the medulla. In majority of nephrons, the loop of Henle is too short and extends only very little into the medulla. Such nephrons are called cortical nephrons. In some of the nephrons, the loop of Henle is very long and runs deep into the medulla. These nephrons are called juxta medullary nephrons. The efferent arteriole emerging from the glomerulus forms a ﬁne capillary network around the renal tubule called the peritubular capillaries. A minute vessel of this network runs parallel to the Henle’s loop forming a ‘U’ shaped vasa recta. Vasa recta is absent or highly reduced in cortical nephrons. Efferent arteriole Bowman ’5 capsule Proximal convoluted tubule Figure 19.4 Malpighian body (renal corpuscle) 19.2 URINE FORMATION Urine formation involves three main processes namely, glomerular ﬁltration, reabsorption and secretion, that takes place in different parts of the nephron. The ﬁrst step in urine formation is the ﬁltration of blood, which is carried out by the glomerulus and is called glomerular ﬁltration. On an average, 1 100- 1200 ml of blood is ﬁltered by the kidneys per minute which constitute roughly 1 /5“‘ of the blood pumped out by each ventricle of the heart in a minute. The glomerular capillary blood pressure causes ﬁltration of blood through 3 layers, i.e., the endothelium of glomerular blood vessels, the epithelium of Bowman’s capsule and a basement membrane between these two layers. The epithelial cells of Bowman’s capsule called podocytes are arranged in an intricate manner so as to leave some minute spaces called ﬁltration slits or slit pores. Blood is ﬁltered so ﬁnely through these membranes, that almost all the constituents of the plasma except the proteins pass onto the lumen of the Bowman’s capsule. Therefore, it is considered as a process of ultra ﬁltration."
biology/,"NEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION contain Nissl’s granules and are called dendrites. These ﬁbres transmit impulses towards the cell body. The axon is a long ﬁbre, the distal end of which is branched. Each branch terminates as a bulb-like structure called Nissl’s granules synaptic knob which possess synaptic vesicles containing chemicals called neurotransmitters. The Cell body axons transmit nerve impulses away from the cell body to a synapse or to a neuro-muscular junction. Based Nucleus on the number of axon and dendrites, the neurons are divided into three types, i.e., multipolar (with one axon and two or more dendn'tes; found in the cerebral cortex), bipolar (with one axon and one dendrite, found in the Schwan cell retina of eye) and unipolar (cell body with one axon only; found usually in the embryonic stage). There are two types of axons, namely, myelinated and non- Axon myelinated. ’Ihe myelinated nerve ﬁbres are enveloped with Schwann cells, which form a myelin sheath Dendrites Myelin around the axon. ’Ihe gaps between two adjacent sheath myelin sheaths are called nodes of Ranvier.

Different types of ion channels are present on the neural membrane. These ion channels are selectively permeable to different ions. When a neuron is not conducting any impulse, i.e., resting, the axonal membrane is comparatively more permeable to potassium ions (K+) and nearly impermeable to sodium ions (Nat). Similarly, the membrane is impermeable to negatively charged proteins present in the axoplasm. Consequently, the axoplasm inside the axon contains high concentration of K+ and negatively charged proteins and low concentration of Na“. In contrast, the ﬂuid outside the axon contains a low concentration of K‘”, a high concentration of Na+ and thus form a concentration gradient. These ionic gradients across the resting membrane are maintained by the active transport of ions by the sodium-potassium pump which transports 3 Na+ outwards for 2 K+ into the cell. As a result, the outer surface of the axonal membrane possesses a positive charge while its inner surface 317 Figure 21.1 Structure of a neuron"

For the car of a particular make, the braking distance was found to be 10 m, 20 m, 34 m and 50 m corresponding to velocities of l 1, 15, 20 and 25 m/s which are nearly consistent with the above formula. Stopping distance is an important factor considered in setting speed limits, for example, in school zones. 4 F Example 3.8 Reaction time : When a situation demands our immediate action, it takes some time before we really respond. Reaction time is the time a person takes to observe, think and act. For example. if a person is driving and suddenly a boy appears on the road. then the time elapsed before he slams the brakes of the car is the reaction time. Reaction time depends on complexity of the situation and on an individual. You can measure your reaction time by a simple experiment. Take a ruler and ask your friend to drop it vertically through the gap between your thumb and forefinger (Fig. 3.15). After you catch it. find the distance d travelled by the ruler. In a particular case, (1 was found to be 21.0 cm. Estimate reaction time. Friend's hand Ruler .1 7;: E; a— ;‘ "". Fig. 3.15 Measuring the reaction time. Answer The ruler drops under free fall.

While that train must be travelling faster than you to be able to pass you, it does seem slower to you than it would be to someone standing on the ground and watching both the trains. In case both the trains have the same velocity with respect to the ground, then to you the other train would seem to be not moving at all. To understand such observations, we now introduce the concept of relative velocity. Consider two objects A and B moving uniformly with average velocities vA and DB in one dimension, say along x-axis. (Unless otherwise specified, the velocities mentioned in this chapter are measured with reference to the ground). Ifo (0) and xB (O) are positions of objects A and B, respectively at time t = 0, their positions xA (t) and xB (t) at time tare given by: xA (t) xA(O) + vA t (3.12a) xB (t) xB(O) + vBt (3.12b) Then, the displacement from object A to object B is given by xBA(t) = x8 (t) — xA (t) =1x,,(0)— x,(0)1+(uB— DA) t. (3.13) Equation (3.13) is easily interpreted. It tells us that as seen from object A, object B has a velocity vB— vA because the displacement from A to B changes steadily by the amount vB— DA in each unit of time. We say that the velocity of object B relative to objectA is vB — vA : — vA (3.14a) vBA = DB Similarly, velocity of object A relative to object B is: v = vA—vB (3.14b) AB 2019-20"

What happens when we breathe? Also, do all living organisms, including plants and microbes, breathe? If so, how? All living organisms need energy for carrying out daily life activities, be it absorption, transport, movement, reproduction or even breathing. Where does all this energy come from? We know we eat food for energy — but how is this energy taken from food? How is this energy utilised? Do all foods give the same amount of energy? Do plants ‘eat’? Where do plants get their energy from? And micro-organisms — for their energy requirements, do they eat ‘food’? You may wonder at the several questions raised above — they may seem to be very disconnected. But in reality, the process of breathing is very much connected to the process of release of energy from food. Let us try and understand how this happens. All the energy required for ‘life’ processes is obtained by oxidation of some macromolecules that we call ‘food’. Only green plants and cyanobacteria can prepare their own food; by the process of photosynthesis they trap light energy and convert it into chemical energy that is stored in the bonds of carbohydrates like glucose, sucrose and starch. We must remember that in green plants too, not all cells, tissues and organs photosynthesise; only cells containing chloroplasts, that are most often located in the superﬁcial layers, carry out photosynthesis. Hence, even in green plants all other organs, tissues and cells that are non-green, need food for oxidation. Hence, food has to be translocated to all non- green parts. Animals are heterotrophic, i.e., they obtain food from plants 2019-2020"
accounts/,"Trial Balance and Rectification of Errors 183 and credit balances in the trial balance are equal, it is assumed that the posting and balancing of accounts is arithmetically correct. However, the tallying of the trial balance is not a conclusive proof of the accuracy of the accounts. It only ensures that all debits and the corresponding credits have been properly recorded in the ledger. 6.2.2 To Help in Locating Errors When a trial balance does not tally (that is, the totals of debit and credit columns are not equal), we know that at least one error has occured. The error (or errors) may have occured at one of those stages in the accounting process: (1) totalling of subsidiary books, (2) posting of j ournal entries in the ledger, (3) calculating account balances, (4) carrying account balances to the trial balance, and (5) totalling the trial balance columns. It may be noted that the accounting accuracy is not ensured even if the totals of debit and credit balances are equal because some errors do not affect equality of debits and credits. For example, the book-keeper may debit a correct amount in the wrong account while making the journal entry or in posting a journal entry to the ledger. This error would cause two accounts to have incorrect balances but the trial balance would tally. Another error is to record an equal debit and credit of an incorrect amount. This error would give the two accounts incorrect balances but would not create unequal debits and credits. As a result, the fact that the trial balance has tallied does not imply that all entries in the books of original record (journal, cash book, etc.) have been recorded and posted correctly. However, equal totals do suggest that several types of errors probably have not occured. 6.2.3 To Help in the Preparation of the Financial Statements Trial balance is considered as the connecting link between accounting records and the preparation of financial statements. For preparing a financial statement, one need not refer to the ledger. In fact, the availability of a tallied trial balance is the first step in the preparation of ﬁnancial statements. All revenue and expense accounts appearing in the trial balance are transferred to the trading and profit and loss account and all liabilities, capital and assets accounts are transferred to the balance sheet. (Preparation of the ﬁnancial statements is explained in chapters, 9 and 1 0). 2019-2020"

Consider a horizontal cylinder with a piston and three vertical tubes at different points [Fig. 10.6 (a)]. The pressure in the horizontal cylinder is indicated by the height of liquid column in the vertical tubes. It is necessarily the same in all. If we push the piston, the ﬂuid level rises in all the tubes, again reaching the same level in each one of them. Fig 1 0.6 (a) Whenever external pressure is applied on any part of a ﬂuid in a vessel, it is equally transmitted in all directions. This indicates that when the pressure on the cylinder was increased, it was distributed uniformly throughout. We can say whenever external pressure is applied on any part of a ﬂuid contained in a vessel, it is transmitted undiminished and equally in all directions. This is another form of the Pascal’s law and it has many applications in daily life. A number of devices, such as hydraulic lift and hydraulic brakes, are based on the Pascal’s law. In these devices, ﬂuids are used for transmitting pressure. In a hydraulic lift, as shown in Fig. 10.6 (b), two pistons are separated by the space ﬁlled with a liquid. A piston of small cross-section A1 is used to exert a force F1 directly F on the liquid. The pressure P = All is transmitted throughout the liquid to the larger cylinder attached with a larger piston of area A2, which results in an upward force of P X A2. Therefore, the piston is capable of supporting a large force (large weight of, say a car, or a truck, Archemedes' Principle Fluid appears to provide partial support to the objects placed in it. When a body is wholly or partially immersed in a ﬂuid at rest. the ﬂuid exerts pressure on the surface of the body in contact with the ﬂuid. The pressure is greater on lower surfaces of the body than on the upper surfaces as pressure in a ﬂuid increases with depth. The resultant of all the forces is an upward force called buoyant force. Suppose that a cylindrical body is immersed in the ﬂuid. The upward force on the bottom of the body is more than the downward force on its top. The ﬂuid exerts a resultant upward force or buoyant force on the body equal to (P2— P1] x A (Fig. 10.3]. We have seen in equation 10.4 that [PZ—P1]A = pghA. Now. hA ls the volume of the solid and phA is the weight of an equivaliant volume of the ﬂuid. (PQ—P1)A = mg. Thus. the upward force exerted is equal to the weight of the displaced ﬂuid. The result holds true irrespective of the shape of the object and here cylindrical object is considered only for convenience. This is Archimedes' principle. For totally immersed objects the volume of the ﬂuid displaced by the object is equal to its own volume. If the density of the immersed object is more than that of the ﬂuid, the object will sink as the weight of the body is more than the upward thrust. If the density of the object is less than that of the ﬂuid. it ﬂoats in the ﬂuid partially submerged. To calculate the volume submerged, suppose the total volume of the object is VS and a part Vp of it is submerged in the ﬂuid. Then. the upward force which is the weight of the displaced ﬂuid is ngp, which must equal the weight of the body: p 9gVS = plngor ps/pl = Vp/Vs The apparent weight of the ﬂoating body is zero. This principle can be summarised as: ‘the loss of weight of a body submerged (partially or fully) in a ﬂuid is equal to the weight of the ﬂuid displaced‘. 2019-20"
biology/,"264 BIOLOGY No significant digestive activity occurs in the large intestine. The functions of large intestine are: (i) absorption of some water, minerals and certain drugs; (ii) secretion of mucus which helps in adhering the waste (undigested) particles together and lubricating it for an easy passage. The undigested, unabsorbed substances called faeces enters into the caecum of the large intestine through ileo-caecal valve, which prevents the back ﬂow of the faecal matter. It is temporarily stored in the rectum till defaecation. The activities of the gastro-intestinal tract are under neural and hormonal control for proper coordination of different parts. The sight, smell and / or the presence of food in the oral cavity can stimulate the secretion of saliva. Gastric and intestinal secretions are also, similarly, stimulated by neural signals. The muscular activities of different parts of the alimentary canal can also be moderated by neural mechanisms, both local and through CNS. Hormonal control of the secretion of digestive juices is carried out by local hormones produced by the gastric and intestinal mucosa. CALORIFIC VALUE OF PROTEIN, CARBOHYDRATE ANDFAT (Boxed item - Not for evaluation) The energy requirements 'of,=aniInals, and the energy content of food, are expressed in terms of measure, of heat energy because heat is the ultimate form of all energies. This is often measured to-as calol'ie (cal) or joule (J), which is the amount of heat energy required to raise th‘e‘temperature of 1 g of water by 1 °C. Since this value istiny amount of energy, physiologists commonly use kilocalorie (kcal) or kilo joule (kJ). One kilo calorie is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water-“by 1 °C. Nutritionists, traditionally refer to kcal as the Calorie \or Joule (always capitalised). The amount of heat liberated from complete combustion of 1‘ g food in a bomb calorimeter (a closed metal chamber ﬁlled with 02) is its gross calon'ﬁc or gross energy value. The actual amount of energy combustion of 1g of food is the physiologic value of food. Gross caloriﬁc values of carbohydrates, proteins and fats are 4.1 kcal/ g, 5.65 kcal/ g and 9.45 kcal / g, respectively, whereas their physiologic values are 4.0 kcal / g, 4.0 kcal / g and 9.0 kcal/g, respectively. 16.3 ABSORPTION 0F DIGESTED PRODUCTS Absorption is the process by which the end products of digestion pass through the intestinal mucosa into the blood or lymph. It is carried out by passive, active or facilitated transport mechanisms. Small amounts of monosaccharides like glucose, amino acids and some electrolytes like chloride ions are generally absorbed by simple diffusion. The passage of these substances into the blood depends upon the concentration gradients. However, some substances like glucose and amino acids are absorbed with the help of carrier proteins. This mechanism is called the facilitated transport. Transport of water depends upon the osmotic gradient. Active transport occurs against the concentration gradient and hence requires energy. Various nutrients like amino acids, monosaccharides like glucose, electrolytes like Na+ are absorbed into the blood by this mechanism. Fatty acids and glycerol being insoluble, cannot be absorbed into the"
biology/,"PLANT KINGDOM nuclei eventually fuse to produce a diploid secondary nucleus. Pollen grain, after dispersal from the anthers, are carried by wind or various other agencies to the stigma of a pistil. This is termed as pollination. The pollen grains germinate on the stigma and the resulting pollen tubes grow through the tissues of stigma and style and reach the ovule. The pollen tubes enter the embryo-sac where two male gametes are discharged. One of the male gametes fuses with the egg cell (syngamy) to form a zygote. The other male gamete fuses with the diploid secondary nucleus to produce the triploid primary endosperm nucleus PEN). Because of the occurrence of two fusions i.e., syngamy and triple fusion, this event is termed as double fertilisation, an event unique to angiosperms. The zygote develops into an embryo (with one or two cotyledons) and the PEN develops into endosperm which provides nourishment to the developing embryo. The synergids and antipodals degenerate after fertilisation. During these events the ovules develop into seeds and the ovaries develop into fruit.

biology/,"CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION The stages through which a cell passes from one division to the next is called the cell cycle. Cell cycle is divided into two phases called (i) Interphase — a period of preparation for cell division, and (ii) Mitosis (M phase) — the actual period of cell division. Interphase is further subdivided into G1, S and G2. G1 phase is the period when the cell grows and carries out normal metabolism. Most of the organelle duplication also occurs during this phase. S phase marks the phase of DNA replication and chromosome duplication. G2 phase is the period of cytoplasmic growth. Mitosis is also divided into four stages namely prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. Chromosome condensation occurs during prophase. Simultaneously, the centrioles move to the opposite poles. The nuclear envelope and the nucleolus disappear and the spindle ﬁbres start appearing. Metaphase is marked by the alignment of chromosomes at the equatorial plate. During anaphase the centromeres divide and the chromatids start moving towards the two opposite poles. Once the chromatids reach the two poles, the chromosomal elongation starts, nucleolus and the nuclear membrane reappear. This stage is called the telophaise. ‘ Nuclear division is then followed by the cytoplasmic d1v1s10n and is callé‘di'cytoklnes1s Mitosis thus, is the equational division i Gill ch the chromosome number of Meiosis is divided into two ph se .. division the homologous chromosomes pair orm bivalents, and undergo crossing over.

During metaphase I the bivalents arrange on the equatorial plate. This is followed by anaphase I in which homologous chromosomes move to the opposite poles with both their chromatids. Each pole receives half the chromosome number of the parent cell. In telophase I, the nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear. Meiosis II is similar to mitosis. During anaphase II the sister chromatids separate. Thus at the end of meiosis four haploid cells are formed. EXERCISES 1. What is the average cell cycle span for a mammalian cell? 2.

If one were to make a list of biomolecules, such a list would have thousands of organic compounds including amino acids, sugars, etc. For reasons that are given in section 9. 10, we can call these biomolecules as ‘metabolites’. In animal tissues, one notices the presence of all such categories of compounds shown in Figure 9.1. These are called primary metabolites. However, when one analyses plant, fungal and microbial cells, one would see thousands of compounds other than these called primary metabolites, e. g. alkaloids, ﬂavonoids, rubber, essential oils, antibiotics, coloured pigments, scents, gums, spices. These are called secondary metabolites (Table 9.3). «@aroiienoiﬂs, thmymﬁm While primary metabolites have identifiable functions and play known roles in normal physiologial processes, we do not at the moment, «Imam: understand the role or functions of all the Eéééﬁﬁﬁlﬁﬂg 11"""" "" ' ‘ ‘secondary metabolites’ in host organisms.

They have molecular weights ranging from 18 to around 800 daltons (Da) approximately. The acid insoluble fraction, has only four types of organic compounds i.e., proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides and lipids. These classes of compounds with the exception of lipids, have molecular weights in the range of ten thousand daltons and above. For this very reason, biomolecules, i.e., chemical compounds found in living organisms are of two types. One, those which have molecular weights less than one thousand dalton and are usually referred to as micromolecules or simply biomolecules while those which are found in the acid insoluble fraction are called macromolecules or biomacromolecules. The molecules in the insoluble fraction with the exception of lipids are polymeric substances. Then why do lipids, whose molecular weights do not exceed 800 Da, come under acid insoluble fraction, i.e., macromolecular fraction? Lipids are indeed small molecular weight"
biology/,"38 BIOLOGY free-living, mostly photosynthetic thalloid gametophytes called prothallus. These gametophytes require cool, damp, shady places to grow. Because of this speciﬁc restricted requirement and the need for water for fertilisation, the spread of living pteridophytes is limited and restricted to narrow geographical regions. The gametophytes bear male and female sex organs called antheridia and archegonia, respectively. Water is required for transfer of antherozoids — the male gametes released from the antheridia, to the mouth of archegonium. Fusion of male gamete with the egg present in the archegonium result in the formation of zygote. Zygote thereafter produces a multicellular well-differentiated sporophyte which is the dominant phase of the pteridophytes. In majority of the pteridophytes all the spores are of similar kinds; such plants are called homosporous. Genera like Selaginella and Salvinia which produce two kinds of spores, macro (large) and micro (small) spores, are known as heterosporous. The megaspores and microspores germinate and give rise to female and male gametophytes, respectively. The female gametophytes in these plants are retained on the parent sporophytes for variable periods. The development of the zygotes into young embryos take place within the female gametophytes. This event is a precursor to the seed habit considered an important step in evolution. The pteridophytes are further classiﬁed into four classes: Psilopsida (Psilotum); Lycopsida (Selaginella, Lycopodium), Sphenopsida (Equisetum) and Pteropsida (Dryopteris, Pteris, Adiantum). 3.4 GYMNOSPERMS The gymnosperms (gymnos : naked, sperma: seeds) are plants in which the ovules are not enclosed by any ovary wall and remain exposed, both before and after fertilisation. The seeds that develop post-fertilisation, are not covered, i.e., are naked. Gymnosperms include medium-sized trees or tall trees and shrubs Wigure 3.4). One of the gymnosperms, the giant redwood tree Sequoia is one of the tallest tree species. The roots are generally tap roots. Roots in some genera have fungal association in the form of mycorrhiza (Pinus), while in some others (Cycas) small specialised roots called coralloid roots are associated with N2- ﬁxing cyanobacteria. The stems are unbranched (Cycas) or branched (Pinus, Cedrus). The leaves may be simple or compound. In Cycas the pinnate leaves persist for a few years. The leaves in gymnosperms are well-adapted to withstand extremes of temperature, humidity and wind. In conifers, the needle-like leaves reduce the surface area. Their thick cuticle and sunken stomata also help to reduce water loss."
biology/,"CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION 10.3 Signiﬁcance of Mitosis Mitosis or the equational division is usually restricted to the diploid cells only. However, in some lower plants and in some social insects haploid cells also divide by mitosis. It is very essential to understand the signiﬁcance of this division in the life of an organism. Are you aware of some examples where you have studied about haploid and diploid insects? Mitosis usually results in the production of diploid daughter cells with identical genetic complement. The growth of multicellular organisms is due to mitosis. Cell growth results in disturbing the ratio between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. It therefore becomes essential for the cell to divide to restore the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio. A very significant contribution of mitosis is cell repair. The cells of the upper layer of the epidermis, cells of the lining of the gut, and blood cells are being constantly replaced. Mitotic divisions in the meristematic tissues — the apical and the lateral cambium, result in a continuous growth of plants throughout their life. 10.4 MEIOSIS The production of offspring by sexual reproduction includes the fusion of two gametes, each with a complete haploid set of chromosomes. Gametes are formed from specialised diploid cells. This specialised kind of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half results in the production of haploid daughter cells. This kind of division is called meiosis. Meiosis ensures the production of haploid phase in the life cycle of sexually reproducing organisms whereas fertilisation restores the diploid phase. We come across meiosis during gametogenesis in plants and animals. This leads to the formation of haploid gametes. The key features of meiosis are as follows: 0 Meiosis involves two sequential cycles of nuclear and cell division called meiosis I and meiosis II but only a single cycle of DNA replication. 0 Meiosis I is initiated after the parental chromosomes have replicated to produce identical sister chromatids at the S phase. 0 Meiosis involves pairing of homologous chromosomes and recombination between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. 0 Four haploid cells are formed at the end of meiosis II. Meiotic events can be grouped under the following phases:"

These are bonded together by interatomic or intermolecular forces and stay in a stable equilibrium position. When a solid is deformed, the atoms or molecules are displaced from their equilibrium positions causing a change in the interatomic (or intermolecular) distances. When the deforming force is removed, the interatomic forces tend to drive them back to their original positions. Thus the body regains its original shape and size.

Robert Hooke, an English physicist (1635 - 1703 AD) performed experiments on springs and found that the elongation (change in the length) produced in a body is proportional to the applied force or load. In 167 6, he presented his law of 2019-20 elasticity, now called Hooke’s law. We shall study about it in Section 9.4. This law, like Boyle’s law, is one of the earliest quantitative relationships in science. It is very important to know the behaviour of the materials under various kinds of load from the context of engineering design. 9.3 STRESS AND STRAIN When forces are applied on a body in such a manner that the body is still in static equilibrium, it is deformed to a small or large extent depending upon the nature of the material of the body and the magnitude of the deforming force. The deformation may not be noticeable visually in many materials but it is there. When a body is subjected to a deforming force, a restoring force is developed in the body. This restoring force is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the applied force. The restoring force per unit area is known as stress. IfFis the force applied normal to the cross—section and A is the area of cross section of the body, Magnitude of the stress = F/A (9.1) The SI unit of stress is N m‘2 or pascal (Pa) and its dimensional formula is [ ML‘I’I“2 ]. There are three ways in which a solid may change its dimensions when an external force acts on it. These are shown in Fig. 9.2. In Fig.9.2(a), a cylinder is stretched by two equal forces applied normal to its cross-sectional area. The restoring force per unit area in this case is called tensile stress. If the cylinder is compressed under the action of applied forces, the restoring force per unit area is known as compressive stress. Tensile or compressive stress can also be termed as longitudinal stress. In both the cases, there is a change in the length of the cylinder. The change in the length AL to the original length L of the body (cylinder in this case) is known as longitudinal strain. AL Longitudinal strain = T (9.2) However, if two equal and opposite deforming forces are applied parallel to the cross-sectional area of the cylinder, as shown in Fig. 9.2(b), there is relative displacement between the opposite faces of the cylinder. The restoring force per unit area developed due to the applied tangential force is known as tangential or shearing stress."
biology/,"116 BIOLOGY 7.5 FROGs Frogs can live both on land and in freshwater and belong to class Amphibia of phylum Chordata. The most common species of frog found in India is Rana tigrina. They do not have constant body temperature i.e., their body temperature varies with the temperature of the environment. Such animals are called cold blooded or poikilotherms. You might have also noticed changes in the colour of the frogs while they are in grasses and on dry land. They have the ability to change the colour to hide them from their enemies (camouﬂage). This protective coloration is called mimicry. You may also know that frogs are not seen during peak summer and winter. During this period they take shelter in deep burrows to protect them from extreme heat and cold. This is known as summer sleep (aestivation) and winter sleep (hibernation) respectively. 7 . 5 . 1 Morphology Have you ever touched the skin of frog? The skin is smooth and slippery due to the presence of mucus. The skin is always maintained in a moist condition. The colour of dorsal side of body is generally olive green with dark irregular spots. On the ventral side the skin is uniformly pale yellow. The frog never drinks water but absorb it through the skin. Body of a frog is divisible into head and trunk (Figure 7 . 19). A neck and tail are absent. Above the mouth, a pair of nostrils is present. Eyes are bulged and covered by a nictitating membrane that protects them while in water. On either side of eyes a membranous Head tympanum (ear) receives sound signals. The forelimbs and hind limbs help in swimming, walking, leaping and burrowing. The hind limbs end in five digits and they are larger and muscular than fore limbs that end in four digits. Feet have webbed digits that help in swimming. Frogs exhibit sexual Fore 11ml) dimorphism. Male frogs can be distinguished by the presence of sound producing vocal sacs and also a Hind limb copulatory pad on the ﬁrst digit of the fore limbs which are absent in female frogs. Eye Figure 7.19 External features of frog 7.5.2 Anatomy The body cavity of frogs accommodate different organ systems such as digestive, circulatory, respiratory, nervous, excretory and reproductive systems with well developed structures and functions (Figure 7 .20). The digestive system consists of alimentary canal and digestive glands. The alimentary canal is short because frogs are carnivores and hence the length of intestine is reduced.

physics/,"MOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 49 Fig. 3.13 FIRST METHOD : In the first method, we split the path in two parts : the upward motion (A to B) and the downward motion (B to C) and calculate the corresponding time taken t1 and t2. Since the velocity at B is zero, we have : v = D0 + at O = 20 — 101:1 Or, t1 = 2 s This is the time in going from A to B. From B, or the point of the maximum height, the ball falls freely under the acceleration due to gravity. The ball is moving in negative y direction. We use equation 1 y: y0 + vot+§at2 We have, y0 =45m, y=O, v0=0, a=—g =—lOmS'2 o = 45 +(1/2)(—10)t22 Solving, we get t2 = 3 s Therefore, the total time taken by the ball before ithitsthe ground: t1+ t2 = 2 s+ 3s =5 s. SECOND METHOD : The total time taken can also be calculated by noting the coordinates of initial and final positions of the ball with respect to the origin chosen and using equation y=yO +v0t+éat2 Now y0=25m y=0m vo=20ms4, a =—lOm S’Z, t = ? O = 25 +20 t + (1/2) (-10) t2 Or, 5t2—20t —25 = 0 Solving this quadratic equation for t, we get t = 5s Note that the second method is better since we do not have to worry about the path of the motion as the motion is under constant acceleration. 4 Example 3.5 Free-fall : Discuss the motion ofan object under free fall. Neglect air resistance. Answer An object released near the surface of the Earth is accelerated downward under the inﬂuence of the force of gravity. The magnitude of acceleration due to gravity is represented by g. If air resistance is neglected, the object is said to be in free fall. If the height through which the object falls is small compared to the earth’s radius, 9 can be taken to be constant, equal to 9.8 m S‘Z. Free fall is thus a case of motion with uniform acceleration. We assume that the motion is in y-direction, more correctly in —y-direction because we choose upward direction as positive. Since the acceleration due to gravity is always downward, it is in the negative direction and we have a=—g =—9.8er2 The object is released from rest at y = 0. Therefore, v0 = 0 and the equations of motion become: v= O—gt =—9.8t ms*1 y=O—1/2gt2 =—4.9t2 m v2=O—2gy =—19.6y m2s*2 These equations give the velocity and the distance travelled as a function of time and also the variation of velocity with distance.

What is growth? Growth can be defined as an irreversible permanent increase in size of an organ or its parts or even of an individual cell. Generally, growth is accompanied by metabolic processes (both anabolic and catabolic), that occur at the expense of energy. Therefore, for example, expansion of a leaf is growth. How would you describe the swelling of piece of wood when placed in water? 15. 1. 1 Plant Growth Generally is Indeterminate Plant growth is unique because plants retain the capacity for unlimited growth throughout their life. This ability of the plants is due to the presence of meristems at certain locations in their body. The cells of such meristems have the capacity to divide and self-perpetuate. The product, however, soon loses the capacity to divide and such cells make up the plant body. This form of growth wherein new cells are always being added to the plant body by the activity of the meristem is called the open form of growth. What would happen if the meristem ceases to divide? Does this ever happen? In Chapter 6, you have studied about the root apical meristem and the shoot apical meristem. You know that they are responsible for the 2019-2020"

Nimbus clouds are shapeless masses of thick vapour. Figure 11.2 Identify these cloud types which are shown in Figure 11.1 and 11.2. A combination of these four basic types can give rise to the following types of clouds: high clouds — cirrus, cirrostratus, cirrocumulus; middle clouds — altostratus and altocumulus; low clouds — stratocumulus and nimbostratus and clouds with extensive vertical development— cumulus and cumulonimbus. FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY Precipitation The process of continuous condensation in free air helps the condensed particles to grow in size. When the resistance of the air fails to hold them against the force of gravity, they fall on to the earth’s surface. 80 after the condensation of water vapour, the release of moisture is known as precipitation. This may take place in liquid or solid form. The precipitation in the form of water is called rainfall, when the temperature is lower than the DOC, precipitation takes place in the form of fine ﬂakes of snow and is called snowfall. Moisture is released in the form of hexagonal crystals. These crystals form ﬂakes of snow. Besides rain and snow, other forms of precipitation are sleet and hail, though the latter are limited in occurrence and are sporadic in both time and space. Sleet is frozen raindrops and refrozen melted snow-water. When a layer of air with the temperature above freezing point overlies a subfreezing layer near the ground, precipitation takes place in the form of sleet. Raindrops, which leave the warmer air, encounter the colder air below. As a result, they solidify and reach the ground as small pellets of ice not bigger than the raindrops from which they are formed. Sometimes, drops of rain after being released by the clouds become solidified into small rounded solid pieces of ice and which reach the surface of the earth are called hailstones. These are formed by the rainwater passing through the colder layers. Hailstones have several concentric layers of ice one over the other.

Development involves a larval stage called tadpole. Tadpole undergoes metamorphosis to form the adult. Frogs are beneﬁcial for mankind because they eat insects and protect the crop. Frogs maintain ecological balance because these serve as an important link of food chain and food web in the ecosystem. In some countries the muscular legs of frog are used as food by man. SUMMARY Cells, tissues, organs and organ systems split up the work in a way that ensures the survival of the body as a whole and exhibit division of labour. A tissue is deﬁned as group of cells along with intercellular substances performing one or more functions in the body. Epithelia are sheet like tissues lining the body’s surface and its cavities, ducts and tubes. Epithelia have one free surface facing a body ﬂuid or the outside environment. Their cells are structurally and functionally connected at junctions. Diverse types of connective tissues bind together, support, strengthen, protect, and insulate other tissue in the body. Soft connective tissues consist of protein ﬁbres as well as a variety of cells arranged in a ground substance. Cartilage, bone, blood, and adipose tissue are specialised connective tissues. Cartilage and bone are both structural materials. Blood is a ﬂuid tissue with transport functions. Adipose tissue is a reservoir of stored energy. Muscle tissue, which can contract (shorten) in response to stimulation, helps in movement of the body and speciﬁc body parts. Skeletal muscle is the muscle tissue attached to bones. Smooth muscle is a component of internal organs. Cardiac muscle makes up the contractile walls of the heart. Connective tissue covers all three types of tissues. Nervous tissue exerts greatest control over the response of body. Neurons are the basic units of nervous tissue. Earthworm, Cockroach and Frog show characteristic features in body organisation. In Pheretima posthuma (earthworm), the body is covered by cuticle. All segments of its body are alike except the 14m, 1 5‘11 and 1 6‘11 segment, which are thick and dark and glandular, forming clitellum. A ring of S-shaped chitinous setae is found in each segment. These setae help in locomotion. On the ventral side spermathecal openings are present in between the grooves of 5 and 6, 6 and 7, 7 and 8 and 8 and 9 segments. Female genital pores are present on 14th segment and male genital pores on 18th segment. The alimentary canal is a narrow tube made of mouth, buccal cavity, pharynx, gizzard, stomach, intestine and anus. The blood vascular system is of closed type with heart and valves. Nervous system is represented by ventral nerve cord. Earthworm is hermaphorodite. Two pairs of"

Equating this to hpg, with experiences this force in the vertical direction, p = 3 x 103 kg m'3 gives and the sides of the mountain are free. Therefore, hpg = 30 x 107 N m‘2 . this is not a case of pressure or bulk compression. h = 30 x 107 N m""2 / (3 x 103 kg m‘3 x 10 m s‘2) There is a shear component, approximately hpg = 10 km itself. Now the elastic limit for a typical rock is which is more than the height of Mt. Everest! SUMMARY 1. Stress is the restoring force per unit area and strain is the fractional change in dimension. In general there are three types of stresses (a) tensile stress — longitudinal stress (associated with stretching) or compressive stress [associated with compression}, (b) shearing stress, and (c) hydraulic stress. 2. For small deformations, stress is directly proportional to the strain for many materials. This is known as Hooke’s law. The constant of proportionality is called modulus of elasticity. Three elastic moduli viz., Young’s modulus, shear modulus and bulk modulus are used to describe the elastic behaviour of objects as they respond to deforming forces that act on them. A class of solids called elastomers does not obey Hooke’s law. 3. When an object is under tension or compression, the Hooke’s law takes the form F/A = YAL/ L where AL/ L is the tensile or compressive strain of the object, Fis the magnitude of the applied force causing the strain, A is the cross-sectional area over which F is applied [perpendicular to A) and Yis the Young’s modulus for the object. The stress is F/A. 4. A pair of forces when applied parallel to the upper and lower faces, the solid deforms so that the upper face moves sideways with respect to the lower. The horizontal displacement AL of the upper face is perpendicular to the vertical height L. This type of deformation is called shear and the corresponding stress is the shearing stress. This type of stress is possible only in solids. In this kind of deformation the Hooke’s law takes the form F/A = G x AL/ L where AL is the displacement of one end of object in the direction of the applied force F, and G is the shear modulus. 5. When an object undergoes hydraulic compression due to a stress exerted by a surrounding ﬂuid, the Hooke’s law takes the form P = B (AV/ VI, where p is the pressure [hydraulic stress) on the object due to the ﬂuid, AV/ V (the volume strain) is the absolute fractional change in the object’s volume due to that pressure and B is the bulk modulus of the object. POINTS TO PONDER I. In the case ofa wire. suspended from celing and stretched under the action ofa weight (Fl suspended from its other end. the force exerted by the ceiling on it is equal and opposite to the weight. However. the tension at any crossesection A of the wire is just Fand not 2F. Hence. tensile stress which is equal to the tension per unit area is equal to F/A. 2. Hooke‘s law is valid only in the linear part of stressrstrain curve. 3. The Young's modulus and shear modulus are relevant only for solids since only solids have lengths and shapes. 4. Bulk modulus is relevant for solids. liquid and gases. It refers to the change in volume when every part of the body is under the uniform stress so that the shape of the body remains unchanged. 2019-20"

The petty cash book generally has a number of columns for the amount on the payment side (credit) besides the ﬁrst other amount column. Each of the amount columns is allotted for items of specific payments, which are most common. The last amount column is designated as ‘Miscellaneous’ followed by a ‘Remarks’ column. In the miscellaneous column those payments are recorded for which a separate column does not exist. In the ‘Remarks’ the nature of payment is recorded. At the end of the period, all amount columns are totaled. The total amount column 1 shows the total amount spent and to be reimbursed. On the receipt (debit) side, there is only one amount column. Columns for the date, voucher number and particulars are common for both receipts and payments. Box 1 Advantages of Maintaining Petty Cash Book Saving of Time and efforts of chief cashier: The chief cashier is not required to deal with petty disbursements. He can concentrate on cash transactions involving large amount of cash. It saves time and labour and helps chief cashier to discharge his duties more effectively Effective control over cash disbursements: Cash control becomes easy because of division of work. The head cashier can control big payments directly and petty payments by keeping a proper check on the petty cashier. This way the chances of making frauds and embezzlements become very difficult. Convenient recording: Recording of petty disbursements in the main cash book makes it bulky and unmanageable. Further, the materiality principle requires that insignificant details need not be given in the main cashbook. This way the cash book reveals only material and useful information. Recording of such small payments becomes easy as the totals of different types of expenses are posted to ledger. It also saves time and effort of posting individual items in the ledger. In nutshell it can be stated that preparation of petty cash book is a cost reduction control measure. For example, Mr. Mohit, the petty cahier of M/s Samaira Traders received Rupees 2,000 on May 01, 2017 from the Head Cashier. For the month, details of petty expenses are listed here under: 2019-2020"

The material making up the light nuclei. usually heavy water (D20) or graphite. is called a moderator.

(6.28). For deuterium m2 = 2m1 and we obtain f1 = 1/9 whilef2 = 8/9. Almost 90% of the neutron’s energy is transferred to deuterium. For carbon j""1 = 71.6% and f2 = 28.4%. In practice, however, this number is smaller since head-on collisions are rare. 4 If the initial velocities and final velocities of both the bodies are along the same straight line, then it is called a one-dimensional collision, or head-on collision. In the case of small spherical bodies, this is possible if the direction of travel of body 1 passes through the centre of body 2 which is at rest. In general, the collision is two- dimensional, where the initial velocities and the final velocities lie in a plane. 6. 12.3 Collisions in Two Dimensions Fig. 6.10 also depicts the collision of a moving mass m1 with the stationary mass m2. Linear momentum is conserved in such a collision. Since momentum is a vector this implies three equations for the three directions (x, y, 2}. Consider the plane determined by the final velocity directions of m1 and m2 and choose it to be the x—y plane. The conservation of the z-component of the linear momentum implies that the entire collision is in the x—y plane. The x— and y-component equations are ”11%: mlvlfcos 01 + mgvycos 02 (6.29) O = mlv sin 61 — n12v2f sin 62 (6.30) 1f One lmows {m1, m2, v1 3 in most situations. There are thus four unknowns {v1f, vgf, 01 and 02}, and only two equations. If 6 1 = 6 2 = O, we regain Eq. (6.24) for one dimensional collision. If, further the collision is elastic, lmv.2=lmv 2+1 v 2 (631) 2 1 11 2 1 1f 2 m2 2f - We obtain an additional equation. That still leaves us one equation short. At least one of the four unknowns, say 0 1, must be made known for the problem to be solvable. For example, 01 can be determined by moving a detector in an angular fashion from the x to the y axis. Given (ml, m2, v”, 01} we can determine {1) 02} 1f’ v2f’ from Eqs. (6.29)-(6.3 l). F Example 6.13 Consider the collision depicted in Fig. 6.10 to be between two billiard balls with equal masses ml = m2. The first ball is called the cue while the second ball is called the target. The billiard player wants to ‘sink‘ the target ball in a corner pocket, which is at an angle 62 = 37°. Assume that the collision is elastic and that friction and rotational motion are not important.

biology/,"RESPIRATION IN PLANTS Now let us compare fermentation and aerobic respiration: ' Fermentation accounts for only a partial breakdown of glucose whereas in aerobic respiration it is completely degraded to CO2 and H20. ° In fermentation there is a net gain of only two molecules of ATP for each molecule of glucose degraded to pyruvic acid whereas many more molecules of ATP are generated under aerobic conditions. ' NADH is oxidised to NAD+ rather slowly in fermentation, however the reaction is very vigorous in case of aerobic respiration. 14.6 AMPHIBOLIC PATHWAY Glucose is the favoured substrate for respiration. All carbohydrates are usually ﬁrst converted into glucose before they are used for respiration. Other substrates can also be respired, as has been mentioned earlier, but then they do not enter the respiratory pathway at the ﬁrst step. See Figure 14.6 to see the points of entry of different substrates in the respiratory pathway. Fats would need to be broken down into glycerol and fatty acids ﬁrst. If fatty acids were to be respired they would ﬁrst be degraded to acetyl CoA and enter the pathway. Glycerol would enter the pathway after being converted to PGAL. The proteins would be degraded by proteases and the individual amino acids (after deamination) depending on their structure would enter the pathway at some stage within the Krebs’ cycle or even as pyruvate or acetyl CoA. Since respiration involves breakdown of substrates, the respiratory process has traditionally been considered a catabolic process and the respiratory pathway as a catabolic pathway. But is this understanding correct? We have discussed above, at which points in the respiratory pathway different substrates would enter if they were to be respired and used to derive energy. What is important to recognise is that it is these very compounds that would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway for the synthesis of the said substrates. Hence, fatty acids would be broken down to acetyl CoA before entering the respiratory pathway when it is used as a substrate. But when the organism needs to synthesise fatty acids, acetyl CoA would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway for it. Hence, the respiratory pathway comes into the picture both during breakdown and synthesis of fatty acids. Similarly, during breakdown and synthesis of protein too, respiratory intermediates form the link. Breaking down processes within the living organism is catabolism, and synthesis is anabolism. Because the respiratory pathway is involved in both anabolism and catabolism, it would hence be better to consider the respiratory pathway as an amphibolic pathway rather than as a catabolic one. 235"

Carbon dioxide (C02) which is harmful is also released during the above catabolic reactions. It is, therefore, evident that 02 has to be continuously provided to the cells and CO2 produced by the cells have to be released out. This process of exchange of 02 from the atmosphere with CO2 produced by the cells is called breathing, commonly known as respiration. Place your hands on your chest; you can feel the chest moving up and down. You know that it is due to breathing. How do we breathe? The respiratory organs and the mechanism of breathing are described in the following sections of this chapter. 17.1 RESPIRATORY ORGANS Mechanisms of breathing vary among different groups of animals depending mainly on their habitats and levels of organisation. Lower invertebrates like sponges, coelenterates, ﬂatworms, etc., exchange 02 with CO2 by simple diffusion over their entire body surface. Earthworms use their moist cuticle and insects have a network of tubes (tracheal tubes) to transport atmospheric air within the body. Special vascularised structures called gills (branchial respiration) are used by most of the aquatic arthropods and molluscs whereas vascularised bags called lungs (pulmonary respiration) are used by the terrestrial forms for the exchange of gases. Among vertebrates, ﬁshes use gills whereas amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals respire through lungs. Amphibians like frogs can respire through their moist skin (cutaneous respiration) also. 2019-2020"

Each muscle bundle contains a number of muscle ﬁbres (Figure 20.1).

Fig. 6.7 shows a block attached to a spring and resting on a smooth horizontal surface. The other end of the spring is attached to a rigid wall. The spring is light and may be treated as massless. In an ideal spring, the spring force F5 is proportional to x where x is the displacement of the block from the equilibrium position. The displacement could be either positive [Fig. 6.7(b)] or negative [Fig. 6.7(c)]. This force law for the spring is called Hooke’s law and is mathematically stated as a=—m The constant k is called the spring constant. Its unit is N m’l. The spring is said to be stiff if k is large and soft if k is small. Suppose that we pull the block outwards as in Fig. 6.7 (b).

physics/,"WAV ES 369 In solids, similar arguments can be made. In a crystalline solid, atoms or group of atoms are arranged in a periodic lattice. In these, each atom or group of atoms is in equilibrium, due to forces from the surrounding atoms. Displacing one atom, keeping the others fixed, leads to restoring forces, exactly as in a spring. So we can think of atoms in a lattice as end points, with springs between pairs of them. In the subsequent sections of this chapter we are going to discuss various characteristic properties of waves. 15.2 TRANSVERSE AND LONGITUDINAL WAVES We have seen that motion of mechanical waves involves oscillations of constituents of the medium. If the constituents of the medium oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, we call the wave a transverse wave. If they oscillate along the direction of wave propagation, we call the wave a longitudinal wave. Fig.15.2 shows the propagation of a single pulse along a string, resulting from a single up and down jerk. If the string is very long compared Fig. 1 5.2 When a pulse travels along the length of a stretched string (x—direction), the elements of the string oscillate up and down (y— direction) to the size of the pulse, the pulse will damp out before it reaches the other end and reﬂection from that end may be ignored. Fig. 15.3 shows a similar situation, but this time the external agent gives a continuous periodic sinusoidal up and down jerk to one end of the string. The resulting disturbance on the string is then a sinusoidal wave. In either case the elements of the string oscillate about their equilibrium mean Harmonic —> L x wave Fig. 1 5.3 A harmonic (sinusoidal) wave travelling along a stretched string is an example of a transverse wave. An element of the string in the region of the wave oscillates about its equilibrium position perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. position as the pulse or wave passes through them. The oscillations are normal to the direction of wave motion along the string, so this is an example of transverse wave. We can look at a wave in two ways. We can fix an instant of time and picture the wave in space. This will give us the shape of the wave as a whole in space at a given instant. Another way is to ﬁx a location i.e. fix our attention on a particular element of string and see its oscillatory motion in time. Fig. 15.4 describes the situation for longitudinal waves in the most familiar example of the propagation of sound waves. A long pipe filled with air has a piston at one end. A single sudden push forward and pull back of the piston will generate a pulse of condensations (higher density) and rarefactions (lower density) in the medium (air). If the push-pull of the piston is continuous and periodic (sinusoidal), a Fig. 1 5.4 Longitudinal waves (sound) generated in a pipe ﬁlled with air by moving the piston up and down.

The alimentary canal is a straight tube and runs between first to last segment of the body. (Figure 7 . 10). A terminal mouth opens into the buccal cavity (1-3 segments) which leads into muscular pharynx. A small narrow tube, oesophagus (5-7 segments), continues into a muscular gizzard (8-9 segments). It helps in grinding the soil particles and decaying leaves, etc. The stomach extends from 9- 14 segments. The food of the earthworm is decaying leaves and organic matter mixed with soil. Calciferous glands, present in the stomach, neutralise the humic acid present in humus. Intestine starts from the 15th segment onwards and continues till the last segment. A pair of short and conical intestinal caecae project from the intestine on the 26‘11 segment. The characteristic feature of the intestine after 26th segment except the last 2301-25th segments is the presence of internal median fold of dorsal wall called typhlosole. This increases the effective area of absorption in the intestine. The alimentary canal opens to the exterior by a small rounded aperture called anus. The ingested organic rich soil passes through the digestive tract where digestive enzymes breakdown complex food into smaller absorbable units. These simpler molecules are absorbed through intestinal membranes and are utilised. Pheretima exhibits a closed type of blood vascular system, consisting of blood vessels, capillaries and heart. (Figure 7.1 1). Due to closed circulatory system, blood is conﬁned to the heart and blood vessels. Contractions keep blood circulating in one direction.

The period of vibrations of a quartz crystal is expressed in units of microseconds (10'6 s) abbreviated as us. On the other hand, the orbital period of the planet Mercury is 88 earth days. The Halley’s comet appears after every 76 years. The reciprocal of T gives the number of repetitions that occur per unit time. This quantity is called the frequency of the periodic motion. It is represented by the symbol v. The relation between v and T is v =1/T (14.1) The unit of v is thus S'l. After the discoverer of radio waves, Heinrich Rudolph Hertz (1857— 1894), a special name has been given to the unit of frequency. It is called hertz (abbreviated as Hz).

In this chapter, we use the term displacement in a more general sense. It refers to change with time of any physical property under consideration. For example, in case of rectilinear motion of a steel ball on a surface, the distance from the starting point as a function of time is its position displacement. The choice of origin is a matter of convenience. Consider a block attached to a spring, the other end of the spring is fixed to a rigid wall [see Fig. l4.2(a)]. Generally, it is convenient to measure displacement of the body from its equilibrium position. For an oscillating simple pendulum, the angle from the vertical as a function of time may be regarded as a displacement variable [see Fig. l4.2(b)]. The term displacement is not always to be referred Fig. 14.2(a) A block attached to a spring, the other end of which is ﬁxed to a rigid wall. The block moves on a frictionless surface. The motion of the block can be described in terms of its distance or displacement x from the equilibrium position. {. Fig.14.2(b) An oscillating simple pendulum; its motion can be described in terms of angular displacement 0 from the vertical. in the context of position only. There can be many other kinds of displacement variables. The voltage across a capacitor, changing with time in an AC circuit, is also a displacement variable. In the same way, pressure variations in time in the propagation of sound wave, the changing electric and magnetic fields in a light wave are examples of displacement in different contexts. The displacement variable may take both positive and negative values. In experiments on oscillations, the displacement is measured for different times. The displacement can be represented by a mathematical function of time. In case of periodic motion, this function is periodic in time. One of the simplest periodic functions is given by f(t) = A cos cot (14.3a) If the argument of this function, cut, is increased by an integral multiple of 27rradians, 2019-20"
physics/,"268 PHYSICS the solid, this will reduce Ssl and therefore, cos 0 may increase or 0 may decrease. In this case 0 is an acute angle. This is what happens for water on glass or on plastic and for kerosene oil on virtually anything (it just spreads). Soaps, detergents and dying substances are wetting agents. When they are added the angle of contact becomes small so that these may penetrate well and become effective. Water proofing agents on the other hand are added to create a large angle of contact between the water and fibres. 10.6.4 Drops and Bubbles One consequence of surface tension is that free liquid drops and bubbles are spherical if effects of gravity can be neglected. You must have seen this especially clearly in small drops just formed in a high-speed spray or jet, and in soap bubbles blown by most of us in childhood. Why are drops and bubbles spherical? What keeps soap bubbles stable? As we have been saying repeatedly, a liquid- air interface has energy, so for a given volume the surface with minimum energy is the one with the least area. The sphere has this property. Though it is out of the scope of this book, but you can check that a sphere is better than at least a cube in this respect! So, if gravity and other forces (e. g. air resistance) were ineffective, liquid drops would be spherical. Another interesting consequence of surface tension is that the pressure inside a spherical drop Fig. 10.20(a) is more than the pressure outside. Suppose a spherical drop of radius r is in equilibrium. If its radius increase by Ar. The extra surface energy is [47c(r + Ar) 2- 47cr2] Sla = 87cr Ar Sla (10.25) If the drop is in equilibrium this energy cost is balanced by the energy gain due to expansion under the pressure difference (Pi — P0) between the inside of the bubble and the outside. The work done is W= (Pi — P0) 47512Ar (10.26) so that (Pi — P0) = (2 Sla/ r) (10.27) 2019-20 In general, for a liquid-gas interface, the convex side has a higher pressure than the concave side. For example, an air bubble in a liquid, would have higher pressure inside it. See Fig 10.20 (b). (a) (b) Fig. 1 0.20 Drop, cavity and bubble of radius r. A bubble Fig 10.20 (c) differs from a drop and a cavity; in this it has two interfaces. Applying the above argument we have for a bubble (P, — P0) = (4 s,,/ r) (10.28) This is probably why you have to blow hard, but not too hard, to form a soap bubble. A little extra air pressure is needed inside! 10.6.5 Capillary Rise One consequence of the pressure difference across a curved liquid-air interface is the well- known effect that water rises up in a narrow tube in spite of gravity. The word capilla means hair in Latin; if the tube were hair thin, the rise would be very large. To see this, consider a vertical capillary tube of circular cross section (radius a) inserted into an open vessel of water (Fig. 10.21). The contact angle between water (b) Fig. 1 0.21 Capillary rise, (a) Schematic picture of a narrow tube immersed water. (b) Enlarged picture near interface."
physics/,"168 PHYSICS there is no need to treat angular velocity as a vector. Further, the angular acceleration, 06 = dw/dt. The kinematical quantities in rotational motion, angular displacement (9), angular velocity ((0) and angular acceleration (a) respectively are analogous to kinematic quantities in linear motion, displacement (x), velocity (v) and acceleration (a). We know the kinematical equations of linear motion with uniform (i.e. constant) acceleration: v = v0 + at (a) 1 x=xO +120t+§at2 (b) v2 = v3 + 2ax (C) where x0 = initial displacement and v0= initial velocity. The word ‘initial’ refers to values of the quantities at t = 0 The corresponding kinematic equations for rotational motion with uniform angular acceleration are: a): 600 + at (7.38) 0 = 00 + wot + g at2 (7.39) and aﬁ = 6002 + 2040— 00) (7.40) where 60: initial angular displacement of the rotating body, and (00 = initial angular velocity of the body.

A wave is not motion of matter as a whole in a medium. A wind is different from the sound wave in air. The former involves motion of air from one place to the other. The latter involves compressions and rarefactions of layers of air. In a wave. emery and not the matter Is transferred from one point to the other. In a mechanical wave. energy transfer takes place because of the coupling through elastic forces between neighbouring oscillating parts of the medium. Transverse waves can propagate only in medium with shear modulus of elasticity. Longitudinal waves need bulk modulus of elasticity and are therefore. possible in all media, solids. liquids and gases. In a harmonic progressive wave of a given frequency. all particles have the same amplitude but different phases at a given instant of time. In a stationary wave. all particles between two nodes have the same phase at a given instant but have different amplitudes. Relative to an observer at rest in a medium the speed of a mechanical wave in that medium (1)) depends only on elastic and other properties [such as mass density) of the medium. It does not depend on the velocity of the source. For an observer moving with velocity I.)0 relative to the medium. the speed of a wave is obviously different from u and is given by v i 00. 2019-20 PHYSICS"

This causes the return of ‘Z’ lines back to their original position, i.e., relaxation. The reaction time of the fibres can vary in different muscles. Repeated activation of the muscles can lead to the accumulation of lactic acid due to anaerobic breakdown of glycogen in them, causing fatigue. Muscle contains a red coloured oxygen storing pigment called myoglobin. Myoglobin content is high in some of the muscles which gives a reddish appearance. Such muscles are called the Red fibres. These muscles also contain plenty of mitochondria which can utilise the large amount of oxygen stored in them for ATP production. These muscles, therefore, can also be called aerobic muscles. On the other hand, some of the muscles possess very less quantity of myoglobin and therefore, appear pale or whitish. These are the White ﬁbres. Number of mitochondria are also few in them, but the amount of sarcoplasmic reticulum is high. They depend on anaerobic process for energy."

Taking one end to be at x = O, the boundary conditions are that x = O and x = L are positions of nodes. The x = 0 condition is already satisfied. The x = L node condition requires that the length L is related to 7L by A L=n§; n=1,2,3,...

For a detailed evaluation of the heart’s function, multiple leads are attached to the chest region. Here, we will talk only about a standard ECG. Each peak in the ECG is identiﬁed with a Figure 18. 3 Diagrammaﬂc presentation of a letter from P to T that corresponds to a speciﬁc standard ECG electrical activity of the heart. The P-wave represents the electrical excitation (or depolarisation) of the atria, which leads to the contraction of both the atria. The QRS complex represents the depolarisation of the ventricles, which initiates the ventricular contraction. The contraction starts shortly after Q and marks the beginning of the systole. The T-wave represents the return of the ventricles from excited to normal state (repolarisation). The end of the T-wave marks the end of systole. Obviously, by counting the number of QRS complexes that occur in a given time period, one can determine the heart beat rate of an individual. Since the ECGs obtained from different individuals have roughly the same shape for a given lead conﬁguration, any deviation from this shape indicates a possible abnormality or disease. Hence, it is of a great clinical signiﬁcance. 18.4 DOUBLE CIRCULATION The blood ﬂows strictly by a ﬁxed route through Blood Vessels—the arteries and veins. Basically, each artery and vein consists of three layers: an inner lining of squamous endothelium, the tunica intima, a middle layer of smooth muscle and elastic fibres, the tunica media, and an external layer of ﬁbrous connective tissue with collagen ﬁbres, the tunica externa. The tunica media is comparatively thin in the veins (Figure 1 8.4) . As mentioned earlier, the blood pumped by the right ventricle enters the pulmonary artery, whereas the left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta. The deoxygenated blood pumped into the pulmonary artery is passed on to the lungs from where the oxygenated blood is carried by the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. This pathway constitutes the pulmonary circulation. The oxygenated blood entering the aorta is carried by a network of arteries, arterioles and capillaries to the tissues from where the deoxygenated blood is collected by a system of venules, veins and vena cava and emptied into the right atrium. This is the systemic circulation (Figure 18.4). The systemic circulation provides nutrients, O2 and other essential substances to the tissues and takes CO2 and other harmful substances away for elimination.

A special neural centre in the medulla oblangata can moderate the cardiac function through autonomic nervous system (ANS). Neural signals through the sympathetic nerves (part of AN S) can increase the rate of heart beat, the strength of ventricular contraction and thereby the cardiac output. On the other hand, parasympathetic neural signals (another component of ANS) decrease the rate of heart beat, speed of conduction of action potential and thereby the cardiac output. Adrenal medullary hormones can also increase the cardiac output. 18.6 DISORDERS 0F CIRCULATORY SYSTEM High Blood Pressure (Hypertension): Hypertension is the term for blood pressure that is higher than normal (120/80).

When such characteristics were considered, the fungi were placed in a separate kingdom — Kingdom Fungi. All prokaryotic organisms were grouped together under Kingdom Monera and the unicellular eukaryotic organisms were placed in Kingdom Protista. Kingdom Protista has brought together Chlamydomonas, Chlorella (earlier placed in Algae within Plants and both having cell walls) with Paramoecium and Amoeba (which were earlier placed in the animal kingdom which lack cell wall). It has put together organisms which, in earlier classiﬁcations, were placed in different kingdoms. This happened because the criteria for classiﬁcation changed. This kind of changes will take place in future too depending on the improvement in our understanding of characteristics and evolutionary relationships. Over time, an attempt has been made to evolve a classiﬁcation system which reﬂects not only the morphological, physiological and reproductive similarities, but is also phylogenetic, i.e., is based on evolutionary relationships. In this chapter we will study characteristics of Kingdoms Monera, Protista and Fungi of the Whittaker system of classiﬁcation. The Kingdoms Plantae and Animalia, commonly referred to as plant and animal kingdoms, respectively, will be dealt separately in chapters 3 and 4. 2. 1 KINGDOM MONERA Bacteria are the sole members of the Kingdom Monera. They are the most abundant micro-organisms. Bacteria occur almost everywhere. Hundreds of bacteria are present in a handful of soil. They also live in extreme habitats such as hot springs, deserts, snow and deep oceans where very few other life forms can survive. Many of them live in or on other organisms as parasites. Bacteria are grouped under four categories based on their shape: the spherical Coccus (pl.: cocci), the rod-shaped Bacillus (pl.: bacilli), the comma-shaped Vibrium (pl.: vibrio) and the spiral Spirillum (pl.: spirilla) (Figure 2.1).

The first amino acid is also called as N-terminal amino acid. The last amino acid is called the C- terminal amino acid. A protein thread does not exist throughout as an extended rigid rod. The thread is folded in the form of a helix (similar to a revolving staircase). Of course, only some portions of the protein thread are arranged in the form of a helix. In proteins, only right handed helices are observed. Other regions of the protein thread are folded into other forms in what is called the secondary structure. In addition, the long protein chain is also folded upon itself like a hollow woolen ball, giving rise to the tertiary structure (Figure 9.4 a, b). This gives us a 3- dimensional view of a protein. Tertiary structure is absolutely necessary for the many biological activities of proteins. Some proteins are an assembly of more than one polypeptide or subunits. The manner in which these individual folded polypeptides or subunits are arranged with respect to each other (e. g. linear string of spheres, spheres arranged one upon each other in the form of a cube or plate etc.) is the architecture of a protein otherwise called the quaternary structure of a protein. Adult human haemoglobin consists of 4 subunits. Two of these are identical to each other. Hence, two subunits of 0c type and two subunits of B type together constitute the human haemoglobin (Hb)."

The total mass of the system is M. (b) Next, take a rigid rod of negligible mass of length of length lwith a pair of small masses, rotating about an axis through the centre of mass perpendicular to the rod (Fig. 7 .28). Each mass M / 2 is at a distance 1/2 from the axis. The moment of inertia of the masses is therefore given by (M/2) (1/2)2 + (M/2)(l/2)2 Thus, for the pair of masses, rotating about the axis through the centre of mass perpendicular to the rod I = Ml2 / 4 Table 7 . 1 simply gives the moment of inertia of various familiar regular shaped bodies about specific axes. (The derivations of these expressions are beyond the scope of this textbook and you will study them in higher classes.) As the mass of a body resists a change in its state of linear motion, it is a measure of its inertia in linear motion. Similarly, as the moment of inertia about a given axis of rotation resists a change in its rotational motion, it can be regarded as a measure of rotational inertia of the body; it is a measure of the way in which different parts of the body are distributed at different distances from the axis. Unlike the mass of a body, the moment of inertia is not a fixed quantity but depends on distribution of mass about the axis of rotation, and the orientation and position of the axis of rotation 2019-20 with respect to the body as a whole. As a measure of the way in which the mass of a rotating rigid body is distributed with respect to the axis of rotation, we can define a new parameter, the radius of gyration. It is related to the moment of inertia and the total mass of the body. Notice from the Table 7.1 that in all cases, we can write I = Mk2, where k has the dimension of length. For a rod, about the perpendicular axis at its midpoint, k2 = L2/12, i.e. k = L/JE. Similarly, k = R/2 for the circular disc about its diameter. The length k is a geometric property of the body and axis of rotation. It is called the radius of gyration. The radius of gyration of a body about an axis may be defined as the distance from the axis of a mass point whose mass is equal to the mass of the whole body and whose moment of inertia is equal to the moment of inertia of the body about the axis. Thus, the moment of inertia of a rigid body depends on the mass of the body, its shape and size; distribution of mass about the axis of rotation, and the position and orientation of the axis of rotation. From the definition, Eq. (7 .34), we can infer that the dimensions of moments of inertia are ML2 and its SI units are kg m2. The property of this extremely important quantity I, as a measure of rotational inertia of the body, has been put to a great practical use. The machines, such as steam engine and the automobile engine, etc., that produce rotational motion have a disc with a large moment of inertia, called a ﬂywheel. Because of its large moment of inertia, the ﬂywheel resists the sudden increase or decrease of the speed of the vehicle. It allows a gradual change in the speed and prevents jerky motions, thereby ensuring a smooth ride for the passengers on the vehicle. 7.10 THEOREMS OF PERPENDICULAR AND PARALLEL AXES These are two useful theorems relating to moment of inertia. We shall first discuss the theorem of perpendicular axes and its simple yet instructive application in working out the moments of inertia of some regular-shaped bodies."
physics/,"26 PHYSICS How will you measure the length of a line? What a naive question. at this stage. you might say! But what if it is not a straight line? Draw a zigzag line in your copy, or on the blackboard. Well. not too difﬁcult again. You might take a thread, place it along the line. open up the thread. and measure its length. Now imagine that you want to measure the length of a national highway. 3 river. the railway track between two stations. or the boundary between two states or two nations. If you take a string of length 1 metre or 100 metre, keep it along the line. shift its position every time. the arithmetic of man-hours of labour and expenses on the project is not commensurate with the outcome. Moreover. errors are bound to occur in this enormous task. There is an interesting fact about this. France and Belgium share a common international boundary. whose length mentioned in the ofﬁcial documents of the two countries differs substantially! Go one step beyond and imagine the coastline where land meets sea. Roads and rivers have fairly mild bends as compared to a coastline. Even so. all documents, including our school books. contain information on the length of the coastline of Gujarat or Andhra Pradesh. or the common boundary between two states. etc. Railway tickets come with the distance between stations printed on them. We have ‘milestones‘ all along the roads indicating the distances to various towns. So, how is it done? One has to decide how much error one can tolerate and optimise cost-effectiveness. If you want smaller errors. it will involve high technology and high costs. Suﬁice it to say that it requires fairly advanced level of physics. mathematics, engineering and technology. It belongs to the areas of fractals. which has lately become popular in theoretical physics. Even then one doesn't know how much to rely on the figure that props up. as is clear from the story of France and Belgium. Incidentally. this story of the FrancevBelgium discrepancy appears on the ﬁrst page of an advanced Physics book on the subject of fractals and chaos! mass density is obtained by deviding mass by the volume of the substance. If we have errors in the measurement of mass and of the sizes or dimensions, we must know what the error will be in the density of the substance. To make such estimates, we should learn how errors combine in various mathematical operations. For this, we use the following procedure. 2019-20 (a) Error of a sum or a difference Suppose two physical quantities A and B have measured values A i AA, B i AB respectively where AA and AB are their absolute errors. We wish to find the error AZ in the sum Z = A + B. We have by addition, Z i AZ = (AiAA) + (BiAB). The maximum possible error in Z AZ 2 AA + AB For the difference Z = A — B, we have ZiAZ= (AiAA)—(BiAB) =(A—B)iAAiAB or, i AZ = i AA i AB The maximum value of the error AZ is again AA + AB. Hence the rule : When two quantities are added or subtracted, the absolute error in the ﬁnal result is the sum of the absolute errors in the individual quantities. Example 2.8 The temperatures of two bodies measured by a thennometer are t1: 20 0C i 0.5 0C and t2 = 50 0C i 0.5 0C. Calculate the temperature difference and the error theirin. Answer t’ = t2—t1 = (50 0C105 0C)— (200Ci0.5 0C) t’ = 30 0C i l 0C { (b) Error of a product or a quotient Suppose Z = AB and the measured values of A and B are A 1 AA and B i AB. Then ZiAZ= (AiAA) (BiAB) =ABi BAAiAABiAAAB. Dividing LHS by Z and RHS by AB we have, li(AZ/ZJ = l i (AA/A) i (AB/B) i (AA/A)(AB/B). Since AA and AB are small, we shall ignore their product. Hence the maximum relative error AZ/ Z= (AA/A) + (AB/B). You can easily verify that this is true for division also. Hence the rule : When two quantities are multiplied or divided, the relative error in the result is the sum of the relative errors in the multipliers."

(Any point like P1 or P2 of the block moves with the same velocity at any instant of time.) block sliding down an inclined plane without any sidewise movement. The block is taken as a rigid body. Its motion down the plane is such that all the particles of the body are moving together, i.e. they have the same velocity at any instant of time. The rigid body here is in pure translational motion (Fig. 7. 1). In pure translational motion at any instant of time, all particles of the body have the same velocity. Consider now the rolling motion of a solid metallic or wooden cylinder down the same inclined plane (Fig. 7.2). The rigid body in this problem, namely the cylinder, shifts from the top to the bottom of the inclined plane, and thus, seems to have translational motion. But as Fig. 7 .2 shows, all its particles are not moving with the same velocity at any instant. The body, therefore, is not in pure translational motion. Its motion is translational plus ‘something else.’ B C Fig. 7.2 Rolling motion of a cylinder. It is not pure translational motion. Points P1, P2, P3 and P4 have different velocities (shown by arrows) at any instant of time. In fact, the velocity of the point of contact P3 is zero at any instant, if the cylinder rolls without slipping. In order to understand what this ‘something else’ is, let us take a rigid body so constrained that it cannot have translational motion. The 2019-20 most common way to constrain a rigid body so that it does not have translational motion is to fix it along a straight line. The only possible motion of such a rigid body is rotation. The line or fixed axis about which the body is rotating is its axis of rotation. If you look around, you will come across many examples of rotation about an axis, a ceiling fan, a potter’s wheel, a giant wheel in a fair, a merry-go-round and so on (Fig 7.3(a) and (b)).

biology/,"114 BIOLOGY opening of the spiracles is regulated by the sphincters. Exchange of gases take place at the tracheoles by diffusion. Excretion is performed by Malpighian tubules. Each tubule is lined by glandular and ciliated cells. They absorb nitrogenous waste products and convert them into uric acid which is excreted out through the hindgut. Therefore, this insect is called uricotelic. In addition, the fat body, nephrocytes and urecose glands also help in excretion. The nervous system of cockroach consists of a series of fused, segmentally arranged ganglia joined by paired longitudinal connectives on the ventral side. ’Ihree ganglia lie in the thorax, and six in the abdomen. The nervous system of cockroach is spread throughout the body. The head holds a bit of a nervous system while the rest is situated along the ventral (belly-side) part of its body. So, now you understand that if the head of a cockroach is cut off, it will still live for as long as one week. In the head region, the brain is represented by supra-oesophageal ganglion which supplies nerves to antennae and compound eyes. In cockroach, the sense organs are antennae, eyes, maxillary palps, labial palps, anal cerci, etc. The compound eyes are situated at the dorsal surface of the head. Each eye consists of about 2000 hexagonal ommatidia (sing: ommatidium). With the help of several ommatidia, a cockroach can receive several images of an object. This kind of vision is known as mosaic vision with more sensitivity but less resolution, being common during night (hence called nocturnal vision). Cockroaches are dioecious and both sexes have well developed reproductive organs (Figure 7.18). Male reproductive system consists of a pair of testes one lying on each lateral side in the 4th -6th abdominal segments. From each testis arises a thin vas deferens, which opens into ejaculatory duct through seminal vesicle. The ejaculatory duct opens into male gonopore situated ventral to anus. A characteristic mushroom- shaped gland is present in the 6‘11-7‘h abdominal segments which functions as an accessory reproductive gland. The external genitalia are represented by male gonapophysis or phallomere (chitinous asymmetrical structures, surrounding the male gonopore). The sperms are stored in the seminal vesicles and are glued together in the form of bundles called spermatophores which are discharged during copulation. The female reproductive sysytem consists of two large ovaries, lying laterally in the 2nd— 6“ abdominal segments. Each ovary is formed of a group of eight ovarian tubules or ovarioles, containing a chain of developing ova. Oviducts of each ovary unite into a single median oviduct (also called vagina) which opens into the genital chamber. A pair of spermatheca is present in the 6th segment which opens into the genital chamber. Sperms are transferred through spermatophores. Their fertilised eggs are encased in capsules called oothecae. Ootheca is a dark reddish to blackish brown capsule, about 3/ 8"" (8 mm) long. They are dropped or"

physics/,"MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 2 71 — 10. 11. Bernoulli’s principle states that as we move along a streamline, the sum of the pressure (P), the kinetic energy per unit volume (p v2 / 2) and the potential energy per unit volume (pgy) remains a constant. P+ pu2/2 + pgy = constant The equation is basically the conservation of energy applied to non viscuss ﬂuid motion in steady state. There is no ﬂuid which have zero viscosity, so the above statement is true only approximately. The viscosity is like friction and converts the kinetic energy to heat energy. Though shear strain in a ﬂuid does not require shear stress, when a shear stress is applied to a ﬂuid, the motion is generated which causes a shear strain growing with time. The ratio of the shear stress to the time rate of shearing strain is known as coefﬁcient of viscosity, 1} where symbols have their usual meaning and are defined in the text. Stokes’ law states that the viscous drag force F on a sphere of radius a moving with velocity v through a ﬂuid of viscosity is, F = — 6mav. Surface tension is a force per unit length [or surface energy per unit area) acting in the plane of interface between the liquid and the bounding surface. It is the extra energy that the molecules at the interface have as compared to the interior. POINTS TO PONDER 1. Pressure is a scalar quantity. The definition of the pressure as “force per unit area"" may give one false impression that pressure is a vector. The “force"" in the numerator of the definition is the component of the force normal to the area upon which it is impressed. While describing ﬂuids as a concept. shift from particle and rigid body mechanics is required. We are concerned with properties that vary from point to point in the ﬂuid. One should not think of pressure of a ﬂuid as being exerted only on a solid like the walls of a container or a piece of solid matter immersed in the ﬂuid. Pressure exists at all points in a ﬂuid. An element of a ﬂuid {such as the one shown in Fig. 10.2] is in equilibrium because the pressures exerted on the various faces are equal. The expression for pressure P= Pu+ p gh holds true if ﬂuid is incompressible. Practically speaking it holds for liquids. which are largely incompressible and hence is a constant with height. The gauge pressure is the difference of the actual pressure and the atmospheric pressure. P— P = P Many pressure—measuring devices measure the gauge pressure. These include the tyre pressure gauge and the blood pressure gauge (sphygmomanometer). A streamline is a map of ﬂuid ﬂow. In a steady ﬂow two streamlines do not intersect as it means that the ﬂuid particle will have two possible velocities at the point. Bernoulli’s principle does not hold in presence of viscous drag on the ﬂuid. The work done by this dissipative viscous force must be taken into account in this case. and P2 [Fig 10.9] will be lower than the value given by Eq. (10.12). As the temperature rises the atoms of the liquid become more mobile and the coefficient of viscosity. 1] falls. In a gas the temperature rise increases the random motion of atoms and nincreases. Surface tension arises due to excess potential energy of the molecules on the surface in comparison to their potential energy in the interior. Such a surface energy is present at the interface separating two substances at least one of which is a ﬂuid. It is not the property of a single ﬂuid alone. 2019-20"

Analogous to the kinetic variables of linear displacement (s) and velocity (v) in translational motion, we have angular displacement (0) and angular velocity (0)) in rotational motion. It is then natural to define in rotational motion the concept of angular acceleration in analogy with linear acceleration defined as the time rate of change of velocity in translational motion. We define angular acceleration a as the time rate of change of angular velocity; Thus, _dm “—5 (7.21) 2019-20 If the axis of rotation is fixed, the direction of a) and hence, that of a is fixed.

These as we shall see, are especially important in the discussion of motion of systems of particles, particularly rigid bodies. 7.7.1 Moment of force (Torque) We have learnt that the motion of a rigid body, in general, is a combination of rotation and translation. If the body is fixed at a point or along a line, it has only rotational motion. We know that force is needed to change the translational state of a body, i.e. to produce linear acceleration. We may then ask, what is the analogue of force in the case of rotational motion? To look into the question in a concrete situation let us take the example of opening or closing of a door. A door is a rigid body which can rotate about a fixed vertical axis passing through the hinges. What makes the door rotate? It is clear that unless a force is applied the door does not rotate. But any force does not do the job. A force applied to the hinge line cannot produce any rotation at all, whereas a force of given magnitude applied at right angles to the door at its outer edge is most effective in producing rotation. It is not the force alone, but how and where the force is applied is important in rotational motion. The rotational analogue of force in linear motion is moment of force. It is also referred to as torque or couple. (We shall use the words moment of force and torque interchangeably.) We shall first define the moment of force for the special case of a single particle. Later on we shall extend the concept to systems of particles including rigid bodies. We shall also relate it to a change in the state of rotational motion, i.e. is angular acceleration of a rigid body."

The external ear receives sound waves and directs them to the ear drum. The ear drum vibrates in response to the sound waves and these vibrations are transmitted through the ear ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) to the oval window. The vibrations are passed through the oval window on to the ﬂuid of the cochlea, where they generate waves in the lymphs. The waves in the lymphs induce a ripple in the basilar membrane. These movements of the basilar membrane bend the hair cells, pressing them against the tectorial membrane. As a result, nerve impulses are generated in the associated afferent neurons. These impulses are transmitted by the afferent ﬁbres via auditory nerves to the auditory cortex of the brain, where the impulses are analysed and the sound is recognised. SUMMARY The neural system coordinates and integrates functions as well as metabolic and homeostatic activities of all the organs. Neurons, the functional units of neural system are excitable cells due to a differential concentration gradient of ions across the membrane. The elT‘levglrical potential difference across the resting neural membrane is called the, ‘resting potential’. The nerve impulse is conducted along the axon membrgim ‘ in the form of a wave of depolarisation and repolarisation. A synap‘é’e‘i’s formed by the membranes of a pre-synaptic neuron and a post-synaptic neuron which may or may not be separated by a gap called synaptic cleft. Chemicals involved in the transmission of impulses at chemical synapses are called neurotransmitters. Human neural system consists of two parts : (i) central neural system (CNS) and (ii) the peripheral neural system. The CNS consists of the brain and spiral cord. The brain can be divided into three major parts : (i) forebrain, (ii) midbrain and (iii) hindbrain. The forebrain consists of cerebrum, thalamus and hypothalamus. The cerebrum is longitudinally divided into two halves that are connected by the corpus callosum. A very important part of the forebrain called hypothalamus controls the body temperature, eating and drinking. Inner parts 327"

SUMMARY All organisms are made of cells or aggregates of cells. Cells vary in their shape, size and activities / functions. Based on the presence or absence of a membrane bound nucleus and other organelles, cells and hence organisms can be named as eukaryotic or prokaryotic. A typical eukaryotic cell consists of a cell membrane, nucleus and cytoplasm. Plant cells have a cell wall outside the cell membrane. The plasma membrane is selectively permeable and facilitates transport of several molecules. The endomembrane system IncludesEEréolgl complex, lysosomes and vacuoles.

In plant cells, chloroplasts are responsible for trapping light energy essential for photosynthesis. The grana, in the plastid, is the site of light reactions and the stroma of dark reactions. The green coloured plastids are chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll, whereas the other coloured plastids are chromoplasts, which may contain pigments like carotene and xanthophyll. The nucleus is enclosed by nuclear envelope, a double membrane structure with nuclear pores. The inner membrane encloses the nucleoplasm and the chromatin material.

biology/,"158 BIOLOGY Concentration of Substrate With the increase in substrate concentration, the velocity of the enzymatic reaction rises at ﬁrst. The reaction ultimately reaches a maximum velocity (Vmax) which is not exceeded by any further rise in concentration of the substrate. This is because the enzyme molecules are fewer than the substrate molecules and after saturation of these molecules, there are no free enzyme molecules to bind with the additional substrate molecules (Figure 9.7). The activity of an enzyme is also sensitive to the presence of speciﬁc chemicals that bind to the enzyme. When the binding of the chemical shuts off enzyme activity, the process is called inhibition and the chemical is called an inhibitor. When the inhibitor closely resembles the substrate in its molecular structure and inhibits the activity of the enzyme, it is known as competitive inhibitor. Due to its close structural similarity with the substrate, the inhibitor competes with the substrate for the substrate- binding site of the enzyme. Consequently, the substrate cannot bind and as a result, the enzyme action declines, e. g., inhibition of succinic dehydrogenase by malonate which closely resembles the substrate succinate in structure. Such competitive inhibitors are often used in the control of bacterial pathogens. 9. 12.5 Classification and Nomenclature of Enzymes Thousands of enzymes have been discovered, isolated and studied. Most of these enzymes have been classiﬁed into different groups based on the type of reactions they catalyse.

Sponges have a water transport or canal system. Water enters through minute pores (ostia) in the body wall into a central cavity, spongocoel, from where it goes out through the osculum. This pathway of water transport is helpful in food gathering, respiratory exchange and removal of waste. Choanocytes or collar cells line the spongocoel and the canals. Digestion is intracellular.

A combination of two simple harmonic motions with arbitrary amplitudes and phases is not necessarily periodic. It is periodic only if frequency of one motion is an integral multiple of the other's frequency. However. a periodic motion can always be expressed as a sum of infinite number of harmonic motions with appropriate amplitudes. The period of SHM does not depend on amplitude or energy or the phase constant. Contrast this with the periods of planetary orbits under gravitation [Kepler's third law). The motion of a simple pendulum is simple harmonic for small angular displacement. For motion of a particle to be simple harmonic. its displacement xmust be expressible in either of the following forms : x=Acos wt + Bsin wt x=Acos[wt+a).x= Bsin[wt+ﬁ) The three forms are completely equivalent (any one can be expressed in terms of any other two forms). Thus. damped simple harmonic motion [Eq. [14.31)] is not strictly simple harmonic. It is approximately so only for time intervals much less than 2m/ b where b is the damping constant. In forced oscillations. the steady state motion of the particle (after the forced oscillations die out) is simple harmonic motion whose frequency is the frequency of the driving frequency cod. not the natural frequency a) of the particle. In the ideal case of zero damping, the amplitude of simple harmonic motion at resonance is infinite. Since all real systems have some damping. however small. this situation is never observed. Under forced oscillation. the phase of harmonic motion of the particle differs from the phase of the driving force. Exercises Which of the following examples represent periodic motion?

Such a classiﬁcation for ﬂowering plants was given by George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker. At present phylogenetic classification systems based on evolutionary relationships between the various organisms are acceptable. This assumes that organisms belonging to the same taxa have a common ancestor. We now use information from many other sources too to help resolve difﬁculties in classiﬁcation. These become more important when there is no supporting fossil evidence. Numerical Taxonomy which is now easily carried out using computers is based on all observable characteristics. Number and codes are assigned to all the characters and the data are then processed. In this way each character is given equal importance and at the same time hundreds of characters can be considered. Cytotaxonomy that is based on cytological information like chromosome number, structure, behaviour and chemotaxonomy that uses the chemical constituents of the plant to resolve confusions, are also used by taxonomists these days. 3. l ALGAE Algae are chlorophyll-bearing, simple, thalloid, autotrophic and largely aquatic (both fresh water and marine) organisms. They occur in a variety of other habitats: moist stones, soils and wood. Some of them also occur in association with fungi (lichen) and animals (e. g., on sloth bear). The form and size of algae is highly variable, ranging from colonial forms like Volvox and the ﬁlamentous forms like Ulothrix and Spirogyra (Figure 3. 1). A few of the marine forms such as kelps, form massive plant bodies. The algae reproduce by vegetative, asexual and sexual methods. Vegetative reproduction is by fragmentation. Each fragment develops into a thallus. Asexual reproduction is by the production of different types of spores, the most common being the zoospores. They are ﬂagellated (motile) and on germination gives rise to new plants. Sexual reproduction takes place through fusion of two gametes. These gametes can be ﬂagellated and similar in size (as in Ulothrix) or non-ﬂagellated (non-motile) but similar in size (as in Spirogyra). Such reproduction is called isogamous. Fusion of two gametes dissimilar in size, as in species of Eudorina is termed as anisogamous. Fusion between one large, non- motile (static) female gamete and a smaller, motile male gamete is termed oogamous, e.g., Volvox, Fucus."

biology/,"PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS Another experiment you may have carried out where a part of a leaf is enclosed in a test tube containing some KOH soaked cotton (which absorbs C02), while the other half is exposed to air. The setup is then placed in light for some time. On testing for the presence of starch later in the two parts of the leaf, you must have found that the exposed part of the leaf tested positive for starch while the portion that was in the tube, tested negative. This showed that CO2 was required for photosynthesis. Can you explain how this conclusion could be drawn? 13.2 EARLY EXPERIMENTS It is interesting to learn about those simple experiments that led to a gradual development in our understanding of photosynthesis. Joseph Priestley (1 733- 1 804) in 1 770 performed a series of experiments that revealed the essential role of air in the growth of green plants. Priestley, you may recall, discovered oxygen in 1774. Priestley observed that a candle burning in a closed space — a bell jar, soon gets extinguished (Figure 13.1 a, b, c, d). Similarly, a mouse would soon suffocate in a closed space. He concluded that a burning candle or an animal that breathe the air, both somehow, damage the air. But when he placed a mint plant in the same bell jar, he found that the mouse stayed alive and the candle continued to burn. Priestley hypothesised as follows: Plants restore to the air whatever breathing animals and burning candles remove. Can you imagine how Priestley would have conducted the experiment using a candle and a plant? Remember, he would need to rekindle the candle to test whether it burns after a few days. How many different ways can you think of to light the candle without disturbing the set-up? Using a similar setup as the one used by Priestley, but by placing it once in the dark and once in the sunlight, Jan Ingenhousz (1730- 17 99) showed that sunlight is essential to the plant process that somehow purifies the air fouled by burning candles or breathing animals. Ingenhousz in an elegant experiment with an aquatic plant showed that in bright sunlight, small bubbles were formed around the green parts while in the dark they did not. Later he identiﬁed these bubbles to be of oxygen. Hence he showed that it is only the green part of the plants that could release oxygen. 207 Figure 13.1 Priestley’s experiment"

A relative motion between the different layers of the ﬂuid is set and, as a result, the body experiences a retarding force. Falling of a raindrop and swinging of a pendulum bob are some common examples of such motion. It is seen that the viscous force is proportional to the velocity of the object and is opposite to the direction of motion. The other quantities on which the force Fdepends are viscosity 1] of the ﬂuid and radius a of the sphere. Sir George G. Stokes (1819— 1903), an English scientist enunciated clearly the viscous drag force F as F=67t77av (10.19) This is known as Stokes’ law. We shall not derive Stokes’ law. This law is an interesting example of retarding force, which is proportional to velocity. We can study its consequences on an object falling through a viscous medium. We consider a raindrop in air. It accelerates initially due to gravity. As the velocity increases, the retarding force also increases. Finally, when viscous force plus buoyant force becomes equal to the force due to gravity, the net force becomes zero and so does the acceleration. The sphere (raindrop) then descends with a constant velocity. Thus, in equilibrium, this terminal velocity vt is given by 67mm)t = (475/ 3) a3 (9-0)!) 2019-20 where p and o are mass densities of sphere and the ﬂuid, respectively. We obtain v. = 2a2 (9-619 / (911) (1020} So the terminal velocity vt depends on the square of the radius of the sphere and inversely on the viscosity of the medium. You may like to refer back to Example 6.2 in this context. Example 1 0.1 O The terminal velocity of a copper ball of radius 2.0 mm falling through a tank of oil at 20""C is 6.5 cm 5"".

All these and many more such experiences are related with the free surfaces of liquids. As liquids have no definite shape but have a definite volume, they acquire a free surface when poured in a container. These surfaces possess some additional energy.

You must have wondered and asked yourself — ‘What is it that makes an organism living, or What is it that an inanimate thing does not have Which a living thing has’ ? The answer to this is the presence of the basic unit of life — the cell in all living organisms. All organisms are composed of cells. Some are composed of a single cell and are called unicellular organisms While others, like us, composed of many cells, are called multicellular organisms. 8.1 WHAT IS A CELL? Unicellular organisms are capable of (i) independent existence and (ii) performing the essential functions of life. Anything less than a complete structure of a cell does not ensure independent living. Hence, cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Anton Von Leeuwenhoek ﬁrst saw and described a live cell. Robert Brown later discovered the nucleus. The invention of the microscope and its improvement leading to the electron microscope revealed all the structural details of the cell. 8.2 CELL THEORY In 1838, Matthias Schleiden, a German botanist, examined a large number of plants and observed that all plants are composed of different kinds of cells Which form the tissues of the plant.

They are re-formed into very small protein coated fat globules called the chylomicrons which are transported into the lymph vessels (lacteals) in the villi. These lymph vessels ultimately release the absorbed substances into the blood stream. Absorption of substances takes place in different parts of the alimentary canal, like mouth, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. However, maximum absorption occurs in the small intestine. A summary of absorption (sites of absorption and substances absorbed) is given in Table 16.1. 265 TABLE 16.1 The Summary of Absorption in Different Parts of Digestive System Mouth Stomach Small Intestine Certain drugs Absorption of Principal organ for absorption coming in contact water, simple of nutrients.

The absorbed substances ﬁnally reach the tissues which utilise them for their activities. This process is called assimilation. The digestive wastes, solidified into coherent faeces in the rectum initiate a neural reﬂex causing an urge or desire for its removal. The egestion of faeces to the outside through the anal opening (defaecation) is a voluntary process and is carried out by a mass peristaltic movement. 16.4 DISORDERS 0F DIGESTIVE SYSTEM The inﬂammation of the intestinal tract is the most common ailment due to bacterial or viral infections. The infections are also caused by the parasites of the intestine like tapeworm, roundworm, threadworm, hookworm, pin worm, etc. Jaundice: The liver is affected, skin and eyes turn yellow due to the deposit of bile pigments. Vomiting: It is the ejection of stomach contents through the mouth. This reﬂex action is controlled by the vomit centre in the medulla. A feeling of nausea precedes vomiting. Diarrhoea: The abnormal frequency of bowel movement and increased liquidity of the faecal discharge is known as diarrhoea. It reduces the absorption of food. Constipation: In constipation, the faeces are retained within the colon as the bowel movements occur irregularly. Indigestion: In this condition, the food is not properly digested leading to a feeling of fullness. The causes of indigestion are inadequate enzyme secretion, anxiety, food poisoning, over eating, and spicy food. 2019-2020 Large Intestine Absorption of water, some minerals and drugs takes place."

They can be easily recorded in special journals, each meant for recording all the transactions of a similar nature. For example, all cash transactions may be recorded in one book, all credit sales transactions in another book and all credit purchases transactions in yet another book and so on. These special journals are also called daybooks or subsidiary books. Transactions that cannot be recorded in any special journal are recorded in journal called the Journal Proper.

The situations (1) and (2) differ from each other because of the absence or presence of relative motion between the observer and the medium. Most waves require a medium for their propagation; however, electromagnetic waves do not require any medium for propagation. If there is no medium present, the Doppler shifts are same irrespective of whether the source moves or the observer moves, since there is no way of distinction between the two situations. 15.8. 1 Source Moving ; Observer Stationary Let us choose the convention to take the direction from the observer to the source as the positive direction of velocity. Consider a source S moving with velocity US and an observer who is stationary in a frame in which the medium is also at rest. Let the speed of a wave of angular frequency a) and period To, both measured by an observer at rest with respect to the medium, be D. We assume that the observer has a detector that counts every time a wave crest reaches it. As shown in Fig. 15.17, at time t = O the source is at point SI, located at a distance L from the observer, and emits a crest. This reaches the observer at time t1 = L/ 1).

geography/,"11092CHI4 CHAPTER he ocean water is dynamic. Its physical I characteristics like temperature, salinity, density and the external forces like of the sun, moon and the winds inﬂuence the movement of ocean water. The horizontal and vertical motions are common in ocean water bodies. The horizontal motion refers to the ocean currents and waves. The vertical motion refers to tides. Ocean currents are the continuous ﬂow of huge amount of water in a definite direction while the waves are the horizontal motion of water. Water moves ahead from one place to another through ocean currents while the water in the waves does not move, but the wave trains move ahead. The vertical motion refers to the rise and fall of water in the oceans and seas. Due to attraction of the sun and the moon, the ocean water is raised up and falls down twice a day. The upwelling of cold water from subsurface and the sinking of surface water are also forms of vertical motion of ocean water. WAVES Waves are actually the energy, not the water as such, which moves across the ocean surface. Water particles only travel in a small circle as a wave passes. Wind provides energy to the waves. Wind causes waves to travel in the ocean and the energy is released on shorelines. The motion of the surface water seldom affects the stagnant deep bottom water of the oceans. As a wave approaches the beach, it slows down. This is due to the friction occurring between the dynamic water and the sea ﬂoor. And, when the depth of water is less than half the MOVEMENTS OF OCEAN WATER wavelength of the wave, the wave breaks. The largest waves are found in the open oceans. Waves continue to grow larger as they move and absorb energy from the wind. Most of the waves are caused by the wind driving against water. When a breeze of two knots or less blows over calm water, small ripples form and grow as the wind speed increases until white caps appear in the breaking waves. Waves may travel thousands of km before rolling ashore, breaking and dissolving as surf. A wave’s size and shape reveal its origin. Steep waves are fairly young ones and are probably formed by local wind. Slow and steady waves originate from far away places, possibly from another hemisphere. The maximum wave height is determined by the strength of the wind, i.e. how long it blows and the area over which it blows in a single direction. Waves travel because wind pushes the water body in its course while gravity pulls the crests of the waves downward.

The adrenal cortex can be divided into three layers, called zona reticularis (inner layer), zona fasciculata (middle layer) and zona glomerulosa (outer layer). The adrenal cortex secretes many hormones, commonly called as corticoids. The corticoids, which are involved in carbohydrate metabolism are called glucocorticoids. In our body, cortisol is the main glucocorticoid. Corticoids, which regulate the balance of water and electrolytes in our body are called mineralocorticoids. Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid in our body. Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis and proteolysis; and inhibit cellular uptake and utilisation of amino acids. Cortisol is also involved in maintaining the cardio-vascular system as well as the kidney functions. Glucocorticoids, particularly cortisol, produces anti- inﬂammatory reactions and suppresses the immune response. Cortisol stimulates the RBC production. Aldosterone acts mainly at the renal tubules and stimulates the reabsorption of Na“ and water and excretion of K’“ and phosphate ions. ’Ihus, aldosterone helps in the maintenance of electrolytes, body ﬂuid volume, osmotic pressure and blood pressure. Small amounts of androgenic steroids are also secreted by the adrenal cortex which play a role in the growth of axial hair, pubic hair and facial hair during puberty. 22.2.8 Pancreas Pancreas is a composite gland (Figure 22.1) which acts as both exocrine and endocrine gland. The endocrine pancreas consists of ‘Islets of Langerhans’. There are about 1 to 2 million Islets of Langerhans in a normal human pancreas representing only 1 to 2 per cent of the pancreatic tissue. The two main types of cells in the Islet of Langerhans are called a—cells and B—cells. The oc—cells secrete a hormone called glucagon, while the B—cells secrete insulin. Glucagon is a peptide hormone, and plays an important role in maintaining the normal blood glucose levels. Glucagon acts mainly on the liver cells (hepatocytes) and stimulates glycogenolysis resulting in an increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia). In addition, this hormone stimulates the process of gluconeogenesis which also contributes to hyperglycemia. Glucagon reduces the cellular glucose uptake and utilisation. Thus, glucagon is a hyperglycemic hormone. Insulin is a peptide hormone, which plays a major role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Insulin acts mainly on hepatocytes and adipocytes (cells of adipose tissue), and enhances cellular glucose 337"
biology/,"LOCOMOT ION AND MOVEMENT Some specialised cells in our body like macrophages and leucocytes in blood exhibit amoeboid movement. It is effected by pseudopodia formed by the streaming of protoplasm (as in Amoeba). Cytoskeletal elements like microﬁlaments are also involved in amoeboid movement. Ciliary movement occurs in most of our internal tubular organs which are lined by ciliated epithelium. The coordinated movements of cilia in the trachea help us in removing dust particles and some of the foreign substances inhaled alongwith the atmospheric air. Passage of ova through the female reproductive tract is also facilitated by the ciliary movement. Movement of our limbs, jaws, tongue, etc, require muscular movement. The contractile property of muscles are effectively used for locomotion and other movements by human beings and majority of multicellular organisms. Locomotion requires a perfect coordinated activity of muscular, skeletal and neural systems. In this chapter, you will learn about the types of muscles, their structure, mechanism of their contraction and important aspects of the skeletal system. 20.2 MUSCLE You have studied in Chapter 8 that the cilia and ﬂagella are the outgrowths of the cell membrane. Flagellar movement helps in the swimming of spermatozoa, maintenance of water current in the canal system of sponges and in locomotion of Protozoans like Euglena. Muscle is a specialised tissue of mesodermal origin. About 40-50 per cent of the body weight of a human adult is contributed by muscles. They have special properties like excitability, contractility, extensibility and elasticity. Muscles have been classified using different criteria, namely location, appearance and nature of regulation of their activities. Based on their location, three types of muscles are identified : (i) Skeletal (ii) Visceral and (iii) Cardiac. Skeletal muscles are closely associated with the skeletal components of the body. They have a striped appearance under the microscope and hence are called striated muscles. As their activities are under the voluntary control of the nervous system, they are known as voluntary muscles too. They are primarily involved in locomotory actions and changes of body postures. Visceral muscles are located in the inner walls of hollow visceral organs of the body like the alimentary canal, reproductive tract, etc. They do not exhibit any striation and are smooth in appearance. Hence, they are called smooth muscles (nonstriated muscle). Their activities are not under the voluntary control of the nervous system and are therefore known as involuntary muscles. ’Ihey assist, for example, in the transportation of food through the digestive tract and gametes through the genital tract."

The winds from the tropics converge at this low pressure zone. The converged air rises along with the convective cell. It reaches the top of the troposphere up to an altitude of 14 km. and moves towards the poles. This causes accumulation of air at about 30° N and S. Part of the accumulated air sinks to the ground and forms a subtropical high. Another reason for sinking is the cooling of air when it reaches 30° N and S latitudes. Down below near the land surface the air ﬂows towards the equator as the easterlies. The easterlies from either side of the equator converge in the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Such circulations from the surface upwards and vice-versa are called cells. Such a cell in the tropics is called Hadley Cell. In the middle latitudes the circulation is that of sinking cold air that comes from the poles and the rising warm air that blows from the subtropical high. At the surface these winds are called westerlies and the cell is known as the Ferrel cell At polar latitudes the cold dense air subsides near the poles and blows towards middle latitudes as the polar easterlies. This cell is called the polar cell. These three cells set the pattern for the general circulation of the atmosphere. The transfer of heat energy from lower latitudes to higher latitudes maintains the general circulation. FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY The general circulation of the atmosphere also affects the oceans. The large-scale winds of the atmosphere initiate large and slow moving currents of the ocean. Oceans in turn provide input of energy and water vapour into the air. These interactions take place rather slowly over a large part of the ocean. General Atmospheric Circulation and its Effects on Oceans Warming and cooling of the Pacific Ocean is most important in terms of general atmospheric circulation. The warm water of the central Pacific Ocean slowly drifts towards South American coast and replaces the cool Peruvian current. Such appearance of warm water off the coast of Peru is known as the El Nino. The El Nino event is closely associated with the pressure changes in the Central Pacific and Australia. This change in pressure condition over Pacific is known as the southern oscillation. The combined phenomenon of southern oscillation and El Nino is known as ENSO. In the years when the ENSO is strong, large-scale variations in weather occur over the world. The arid west coast of South America receives heavy rainfall, drought occurs in Australia and sometimes in India and ﬂoods in China. This phenomenon is closely monitored and is used for long range forecasting in major parts of the world. Seasonal Wind The pattern of wind circulation is modified in different seasons due to the shifting of regions of maximum heating, pressure and wind belts. The most pronounced effect of such a shift is noticed in the monsoons, especially over southeast Asia. You would be studying the details of monsoon in the book India: Physical Environment (NCERT, 2006). The other local deviations from the general circulation system are as follows. Local Winds Differences in the heating and cooling of earth surfaces and the cycles those develop daily or annually can create several common, local or regional winds. 2019-2020"

biology/,"BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 2.4 KINGDOM PLANTAE Kingdom Plantae includes all eukaryotic chlorophyll-containing organisms commonly called plants. A few members are partially heterotrophic such as the insectivorous plants or parasites. Bladderwort and Venus ﬂy trap are examples of insectivorous plants and Cuscuta is a parasite. The plant cells have an eukaryotic structure with prominent chloroplasts and cell wall mainly made of cellulose. You will study the eukaryotic cell structure in detail in Chapter 8. Plantae includes algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms. Life cycle of plants has two distinct phases — the diploid sporophytic and the haploid gametophytic — that alternate with each other. The lengths of the haploid and diploid phases, and whether these phases are free— living or dependent on others, vary among different groups in plants. This phenomenon is called alternation of generation. You will study further details of this kingdom in Chapter 3. 2.5 KINGDOM ANIMALIA This kingdom is characterised by heterotrophic eukaryotic organisms that are multicellular and their cells lack cell walls. They directly or indirectly depend on plants for food. They digest their food in an internal cavity and store food reserves as glycogen or fat. Their mode of nutrition is holozoic — by ingestion of food. They follow a deﬁnite grth pattern and grow into adults that have a deﬁnite shape and size. Higher forms show elaborate sensory and neuromotor mechanism. Most of them are capable of locomotion. The sexual reproduction is by copulation of male and female followed by embryological development. Salient features of various phyla are described in Chapter 4. 2.6 VIRUSES, VIROIDS, PRIONs AND LICHENS In the ﬁve kingdom classiﬁcation of Whittaker there is no mention of lichens and some acellular organisms like viruses, viroids and prions. These are brieﬂy introduced here. All of us who have suffered the ill effects of common cold or ‘ﬂu’ know what effects viruses can have on us, even if we do not associate it with our condition. Viruses did not ﬁnd a place in classiﬁcation since they are not considered truly ‘living’, if we understand lian as those organisms that have a cell structure. The viruses are non-cellular organisms that are characterised by having an inert crystalline structure outside the lian cell. 25"

biology/,"202 BIOLOGY called biological nitrogen ﬁxation. The enzyme, nitrogenase which is capable of nitrogen reduction is present exclusively in prokaryotes. Such microbes are called N2"" ﬁxers. Nitrogenase NEN NHS The nitrogen-ﬁxing microbes could be free-living or symbiotic. Examples of free-living nitrogen-ﬁxing aerobic microbes are Azotobacter and Beyerinckia while Rhodospirillum is anaerobic and free-living. In addition, a number of cyanobacteria such as Anabaena and Nostoc are also free- living nitrogen-fixers. Symbiotic biological nitrogen ﬁxation Several types of symbiotic biological nitrogen ﬁxing associations are known. The most prominent among them is the legume-bacteria relationship. Species of rod-shaped Rhizobium has such relationship with the roots of several legumes such as alfalfa, sweet clover, sweet pea, lentils, garden pea, broad bean, clover beans, etc. The most common association on roots is as nodules. These nodules are small outgrowths on the roots. The microbe, Frankia, also produces nitrogen-ﬁxing nodules on the roots of non- leguminous plants (e.g., Alnus). Both Rhizobium and Frankia are free- living in soil, but as symbionts, can ﬁx atmospheric nitrogen. Uproot any one plant of a common pulse, just before ﬂowering. You will see near-spherical outgrowths on the roots. These are nodules. If you cut through them you will notice that the central portion is red or pink. What makes the nodules pink? This is due to the presence of leguminous haemoglobin or leg-haemoglobin. Nodule Formation Nodule formation involves a sequence of multiple interactions between Rhizobium and roots of the host plant. Principal stages in the nodule formation are summarised as follows: Rhizobia multiply and colonise the surroundings of roots and get attached to epidermal and root hair cells. The root-hairs curl and the bacteria invade the root-hair. An infection thread is produced carrying the bacteria into the cortex of the root, where they initiate the nodule formation in the cortex of the root. Then the bacteria are released from the thread into the cells which leads to the differentiation of specialised nitrogen ﬁxing cells. The nodule thus formed, establishes a direct vascular connection with the host for exchange of nutrients. These events are depicted in Figure 12.4. The nodule contains all the necessary biochemical components, such as the enzyme nitrogenase and leghaemoglobin. The enzyme nitrogenase is a Mo-Fe protein and catalyses the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, (Figure 12.5) the ﬁrst stable product of nitrogen ﬁxation."
physics/,"SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION I77 — 15. Rotation about a fixed axis is directly analogous to linear motion in respect of kinematics and dynamics. 16. For a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis (say, z—axis) of rotation, LZ = [(0, where I is the moment of inertia about z—axis. In general, the angular momentum L for such a body is not along the axis of rotation. Only if the body is symmetric about the axis of rotation, L is along the axis of rotation. In that case, |L| = LZ = I a). The angular acceleration of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis is given by Ia = r. If the external torque ”C acting on the body is zero, the component of angular momentum about the fixed axis (say, z—axis), LZ (=Ico) of such a rotating body is constant. 1 7. For rolling motion without slipping vcm = Ra), where vcm is the velocity of translation (i.e. of the centre of mass), R is the radius and mis the mass of the body. The kinetic energy of such a rolling body is the sum of kinetic energies of translation and rotation: 1 1 K=§mv§m+51w2 9...... .,.....—w_ V = (I) X l' Angular velocity on ['I‘“] rad s‘ Angularmomentum L [ML”T“] J s L =r xp} Torque T [ML’T '3] N m 1' = 1‘ XE Moment of inertia 1 [ML’] . kg m2 I =* {Emir}2 POINTS T0 PONDER 1. To determine the motion of the centre of mass of a system no knowledge of internal forces of the system is required. For this purpose we need to know only the external forces on the body. Separating the motion of a system of particles as the motion of the centre of mass. (i.e.. the translational motion of the system) and motion about (i.e. relative to) the centre of mass of the system is a useful technique in dynamics of a system of particles. One example of this technique is separating the kinetic energy of a system of particles K as the kinetic energy of the system about its centre of mass K’ and the kinetic energl of the centre of mass MVZ/2. K = K’ + MW/ 2 Newton’s Second Law for finite sized bodies (or systems of particles) is based in N ewton‘s Second Law and also Newton's Third Law for particles. To establish that the time rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system of particles is the total external torque in the system, we need not only Newton‘s second law for particles. but also N ewton's third law with the provision that the forces between any two particles act along the line joining the particles. The vanishing of the total external force and the vanishing of the total external torque are independent conditions. We can have one without the other. In a couple. total external force is zero, but total torque is non—zero. The total torque on a system is independent of the origin if the total external force is zero. The centre of gravity of a body coincides with its centre of mass only if the gravitational field does not vary from one part of the body to the other. The angular momentum L and the angular velocity 0) are not necessarily parallel vectors. However. for the simpler situations discussed in this chapter when rotation is about a fixed axis which is an axis of symmetry of the rigid body. the relation L = 10) holds good. where I is the moment of the inertia of the body about the rotation axis. 2019-20"
geography/,"BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION ecosystems of which we are also a species. This fact must be drawn upon every one of us so that we live and let other species also live their lives. It is our ethical responsibility to consider that each and every species along with us have an intrinsic right to exist. Hence, it is morally wrong to voluntarily cause the extinction of any species. The level of biodiversity is a good indicator of the state of our relationships with other living species. In fact, the concept of biodiversity is an integral part of many human cultures. Loss OF BIODIVERSITY Since the last few decades, growth in human population has increased the rate of consumption of natural resources. It has accelerated the loss of species and habitation in different parts of the world. Tropical regions which occupy only about one-fourth of the total area of the world, contain about three- fourth of the world human population. Over- exploitation of resources and deforestation have become rampant to fulﬁl the needs of large population. As these tropical rain forests contain 50 per cent of the species on the earth, destruction of natural habitats have proved disastrous for the entire biosphere. Natural calamities such as earthquakes, ﬂoods, volcanic eruptions, forest fires, droughts, etc. cause damage to the ﬂora and fauna of the earth, bringing change the biodiversity of respective affected regions. Pesticides and other pollutants such as hydrocarbons and toxic heavy metals destroy the weak and sensitive species. Species which are not the natural inhabitants of the local habitat but are introduced into the system, are called exotic species. There are many examples when a natural biotic community of the ecosystem suffered extensive damage because of the introduction of exotic species. During the last few decades, some animals like tigers, elephants, rhinoceros, crocodiles, minks and birds were hunted mercilessly by poachers for their horn, tusks, hides, etc. It has resulted in the rendering of certain types of organisms as endangered category. 133 The International Union of Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) has classified the threatened species of plants and animals into three categories for the purpose of their conservation. Endangered Species It includes those species which are in danger of extinction. The IUCN publishes information about endangered species world-wide as the Red List of threatened species. Figure 16.2 : Red Panda — an endangered species Vulnerable Species This includes the species which are likely to be in danger of extinction in near future if the factors threatening to their extinction continue. Survival of these species is not assured as their population has reduced greatly. Rare Species Population of these species is very small in the world; they are conﬁned to limited areas or thinly scattered over a wider area. CONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY Biodiversity is important for human existence. All forms of life are so closely interlinked that disturbance in one gives rise to imbalance in the others. If species of plants and animals become endangered, they cause degradation in the environment, which may threaten human beings own existence. 2019-2020"
biology/,"ANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS present on the inner side of the endodermis and above the phloem in the form of semi-lunar patches of sclerenchyma. In between the vascular bundles there are a few layers of radially placed parenchymatous cells, which constitute medullary rays. A large number of vascular bundles are arranged in a ring ; the ‘ring’ arrangement of vascular bundles is a characteristic of dicot stem. Each vascular bundle is conjoint, open, and with endarch protoxylem. A large number of rounded, parenchymatous cells with large intercellular spaces which occupy the central portion of the stem constitute the pith. 6.3.4 Monocotyledonous Stem The monocot stem has a sclerenchymatous hypodermis, a large number of scattered vascular bundles, each surrounded by a sclerenchymatous bundle sheath, and a large, conspicuous parenchymatous ground tissue (Figure 6.7b). Vascular bundles are conjoint and closed. Peripheral vascular bundles are generally smaller than the centrally located ones. The phloem parenchyma is absent, and water-containing cavities are present within the vascular bundles. 6.3.5 Dorsiventral (Dicotyledonous) Leaf The vertical section of a dorsiventral leaf through the lamina shows three main parts, namely, epidermis, mesophyll and vascular system. The epidermis which covers both the upper surface (adaxial epidermis) and lower surface (abaxial epidermis) of the leaf has a conspicuous cuticle. The abaXial epidermis generally bears more stomata than the adaxial epidermis. The latter may even lack stomata. The tissue between the upper and the lower epidermis is called the mesophyll. Mesophyll, which possesses chloroplasts and carry out photosynthesis, is made up of parenchyma. It has two types of cells — the palisade parenchyma and the spongy parenchyma. The adaxially placed palisade parenchyma is made up of elongated cells, which are arranged vertically and parallel to each other. The oval or round and loosely arranged spongy parenchyma is situated below the palisade cells and extends to the lower epidermis. There are numerous large spaces and air cavities between these cells. Vascular system includes vascular bundles, which can be seen in the veins and the midrib. The size of the vascular bundles are dependent on the size of the veins. The veins vary in thickness in the reticulate venation of the dicot leaves. The vascular bundles are surrounded by a layer of thick walled bundle sheath cells. Look at Figure 6.8 (a) and ﬁnd the position of xylem in the vascular bundle. 6.3.6 Isobilateral (Monocotyledonous) Leaf The anatomy of isobilateral leaf is similar to that of the dorsiventral leaf in many ways.

biology/,"14 BIOLOGY Flora, manuals, monographs and catalogues are some other means of recording descriptions. They also help in correct identiﬁcation. Flora contains the actual account of habitat and distribution of plants of a given area. These provide the index to the plant species found in a particular area. Manuals are useful in providing information for identiﬁcation of names of species found in an area. Monographs contain information on any one taxon. SUMMARY The living world is rich in variety. Millions of plants and animals have been identiﬁed and described but a large number still remains unknown. The very range of organisms in terms of size, colour, habitat, physiological and morphological features make us seek the defining characteristics of living organisms. In order to facilitate the study of kinds and diversity of organisms, biologists have evolved certain rules and principles for identiﬁcation, nomenclature and classiﬁcation of organisms. The branch of knowledge dealing with these aspects is referred to as taxonomy. The taxonomic studies of various species of plants and animals are useful in agriculture, forestry, industry and in general for knowing our bio-resources and their diversity. The basics of taxonomy like identiﬁcation, naming and classiﬁcation of organisms are universally evolved under international codes. Based on the resemblances and distinct differences, each organism is identiﬁed and assigned a correct scientiﬁc/ biological name comprising two words as per the binomial system of nomenclature. An organism represents / occupies a place or position in the system of classiﬁcation. There are many categories / ranks and are generally referred to as taxonomic categories or taxa. All the categories constitute a taxonomic hierarchy. Taxonomists have developed a variety of taxonomic aids to facilitate identiﬁcation, naming and classiﬁcation of organisms. These studies are carried out from the actual specimens which are collected from the ﬁeld and preserved as referrals in the form of herbaria, museums and in botanical gardens and zoological parks. It requires special techniques for collection and preservation of specimens in herbaria and museums. Live specimens, on the other hand, of plants and animals, are found in botanical gardens or in zoological parks. Taxonomists also prepare and disseminate information through manuals and monographs for further taxonomic studies. Taxonomic keys are tools that help in identiﬁcation based on characteristics."
physics/,"372 PHYSICS 15.3.2 Wavelength and Angular Wave Number The minimum distance between two points having the same phase is called the wavelength of the wave, usually denoted by 7L. For simplicity, we can choose points of the same phase to be crests or troughs. The wavelength is then the distance between two consecutive crests or troughs in a wave. Taking q) = O in Eq. (15.2), the displacement at t= O is given by y(x,0)= asinkx (15.5) Since the sine function repeats its value after every 27: change in angle, sinkx = sin(kx + 2n7r) = sink (x + %) That is the displacements at points x and at 2n7r x+— k are the same, where n=1,2,3,... The least distance between points with the same displacement (at any given instant of time) is obtained by taking n = 1. A, is then given by 27: 27: xi:— k:— k or ,1 (15.6) k is the angular wave number or propagation constant; its SI unit is radian per metre or rad m‘1 * 15.3.3 Period. Angular Frequency and Frequency Fig. 15.7 shows again a sinusoidal plot. It describes not the shape of the wave at a certain instant but the displacement of an element (at any fixed location) of the medium as a function of time. We may for, simplicity, take Eq. (15.2) with (1) = O and monitor the motion of the element say at x = 0 . We then get y(0, t) = a sin(—a)t) = —a sin wt <—T—> Fig. 15.7 An element of a string at a ﬁxed location oscillates in time with amplitude a and period T, as the wave passes over it. Now, the period of oscillation of the wave is the time it takes for an element to complete one full oscillation. That is —a sin cat = —a sin w(t + T) = —a sin(a)t + wT) Since sine function repeats after every 271;, 27; wT = 27: 01‘ a): T (15.7) 0) is called the angular frequency of the wave. Its SI unit is rad 3'1. The frequency v is the number of oscillations per second. Therefore, 1 a) V : _ : _ T 27r V is usually measured in hertz. In the discussion above, reference has always been made to a wave travelling along a string or a transverse wave. In a longitudinal wave, the displacement of an element of the medium is parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave. In Eq. (15.2), the displacement function for a longitudinal wave is written as, s(x, t) = a sin (kx— cot + (p) (15.9) (15.8) where s(x, t) is the displacement of an element of the medium in the direction of propagation of the wave at position xand time t. In Eq. (15.9), a is the displacement amplitude; other quantities have the same meaning as in case of a transverse wave except that the displacement function y (x, t) is to be replaced by the function 5 (x, t). * Here again, ‘radian’ could be dropped and the units could be written merely as m’l. Thus, k represents 27: times the number of waves (or the total phase difference) that can be accommodated per unit length, with SI units m‘1. 2019-20"

What is (i) the direction of the force on the wall due to each ball? (ii) the ratio of the magnitudes of impulses imparted to the balls by the wall ’? (*0 (b) Fig. 5.6 Answer An instinctive answer to (i) might be that the force on the wall in case (a) is normal to the wall, while that in case (b) is inclined at 30° to the normal. This answer is wrong. The force on the wall is normal to the wall in both cases. How to find the force on the wall? The trick is to consider the force (or impulse) on the ball due to the wall using the second law, and then use the third law to answer (i). Let u be the speed of each ball before and after collision with the wall, and m the mass of each ball. Choose the x and y axes as shown in the ﬁgure, and consider the change in momentum of the ball in each case : Case (a) (px )Inltial = mu (pg )lnltlal = 0 (pX)ﬁna1=_mu (py)ﬁml =0 Impulse is the change in momentum vector. Therefore, x—component of impulse = — 2 m u y-component of impulse = O Impulse and force are in the same direction. Clearly, from above, the force on the ball due to the wall is normal to the wall, along the negative x-direction. Using Newton’s third law of motion, the force on the wall due to the ball is normal to the wall along the positive x-direction. The 2019-20 magnitude of force cannot be ascertained since the small time taken for the collision has not been specified in the problem. Case (b) (px)initial = mucos 30° , (Py)mm = — Tl'lLl.Sll’1-30o (px)_/inal = —mucos30°, (py)ﬁm,, = — musin30° Note, while px changes sign after collision, py does not. Therefore, x—component of impulse = —2 m u cos 30° y-component of impulse = O The direction of impulse (and force) is the same as in (a) and is normal to the wall along the negative x direction. As before, using Newton’s third law, the force on the wall due to the ball is normal to the wall along the positive x direction. The ratio of the magnitudes of the impulses imparted to the balls in (a) and (b) is 2mu/(2mucos30°)=l~l.2 ‘ J3 5.7 CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM The second and third laws of motion lead to an important consequence: the law of conservation of momentum. Take a familiar example. A bullet is fired from a gun. If the force on the bullet by the gun is F, the force on the gun by the bullet is —F, according to the third law. The two forces act for a common interval of time At. According to the second law, F At is the change in momentum of the bullet and — F At is the change in momentum of the gun. Since initially, both are at rest, the change in momentum equals the final momentum for each. Thus if pb is the momentum of the bullet after firing and p9 is the recoil momentum of the gun, p9 = —pb i.e. pb + p9 = 0. That is, the total momentum of the (bullet + gun) system is conserved. Thus in an isolated system (i.e. a system with no external force), mutual forces between pairs of particles in the system can cause momentum change in individual particles, but since the mutual forces for each pair are equal and opposite, the momentum changes cancel in pairs and the total momentum remains unchanged. This fact is known as the law of conservation of momentum :"

Transverse waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Longitudinal waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate along the direction of wave propagation. Progressive wave is a wave that moves from one point of medium to another. The displacement in a sinusoidal wave propagating in the positive x direction is given by y (x, t) = asin [kx— cot+ (p) where a is the amplitude of the wave, k is the angular wave number, a) is the angular frequency, [kx — cot + 4)) is the phase, and q) is the phase constant or phase angle. Wavelength A of a progressive wave is the distance between two consecutive points of the same phase at a given time. In a stationary wave, it is twice the distance between two consecutive nodes or antinodes. Period T of oscillation of a wave is defined as the time any element of the medium takes to move through one complete oscillation.

biology/,"PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS channel of the CFO of the ATP synthase. The ATP synthase enzyme consists of two parts: one called the CFO is embedded in the thylakoid membrane and forms a transmembrane channel that carries out facilitated diffusion of protons across the membrane. The other portion is called CF1 and protrudes on the outer surface of the thylakoid membrane on the side that faces the stroma. The break down of the gradient provides enough energy to cause a conformational change in the CF1 particle of the ATP synthase, which makes the enzyme synthesise several molecules of energy- packed ATP. Chemiosmosis requires a membrane, a proton pump, a proton gradient and ATP synthase. Energy is used to pump protons across a membrane, to create a gradient or a high concentration of protons within the thylakoid lumen. ATP synthase has a channel that allows diffusion of protons back across the membrane; this releases enough energy to activate ATP synthase enzyme that catalyses the formation of ATP. Along with the NADPH produced by the movement of electrons, the ATP will be used immediately in the biosynthetic reaction taking place in the stroma, responsible for ﬁxing 002, and synthesis of sugars. 13.7 WHERE ARE THE ATP AND NADPH USED? We learnt that the products of light reaction are ATP, NADPH and 02. Of these 02 diffuses out of the chloroplast while ATP and NADPH are used to drive the processes leading to the synthesis of food, more accurately, sugars. This is the biosynthetic phase of photosynthesis. This process does not directly depend on the presence of light but is dependent on the products of the light reaction, i.e., ATP and NADPH, besides CO2 and H20. You may wonder how this could be veriﬁed; it is simple: immediately after light becomes unavailable, the biosynthetic process continues for some time, and then stops. If then, light is made available, the synthesis starts again. Can we, hence, say that calling the biosynthetic phase as the dark reaction is a misnomer? Discuss this amongst yourselves. Let us now see how the ATP and NADPH are used in the biosynthetic phase. We saw earlier that CO2 is combined with H20 to produce (CH20)n or sugars. It was of interest to scientists to ﬁnd out how this reaction proceeded, or rather what was the ﬁrst product formed when CO2 is taken into a reaction or ﬁxed. Just after world war 11, among the several efforts to put radioisotopes to beneﬁcial use, the work of Melvin Calvin is exemplary. The use of radioactive 14C by him in algal photosynthesis studies led to the discovery that the ﬁrst CO2 ﬁxation product was a 3-carbon organic acid. He also contributed to working out the complete biosynthetic pathway; hence it was called Calvin cycle after him. The ﬁrst product identiﬁed was 3-phosphoglyceric acid or in short PGA. How many carbon atoms does it have?"

The R group in these proteinaceous amino acids could be a hydrogen (the amino acid is called glycine), a methyl group (alanine), hydroxy methyl (serine), etc. Three of the twenty are shown in Figure 9.1. The chemical and physical properties of amino acids are essentially of the amino, carboxyl and the R functional groups. Based on number of amino and carboxyl groups, there are acidic (e. g., glutamic acid), basic (lysine) and neutral (valine) amino acids. Similarly, there are aromatic amino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan). A particular property of amino acids is the ionizable nature of —NH2 and —COOH groups.

A fatty acid has a carboxyl group attached to an R group. The R group could be a methyl (—CHS), or ethyl (_C2H5) or higher number of —CH2 groups (1 carbon to 19 carbons). For example, palmitic acid has 16 carbons including carboxyl carbon. Arachidonic acid has 20 carbon atoms including the carboxyl carbon. Fatty acids could be saturated (without double bond) or unsaturated (with one or more C=C double bonds). Another simple lipid is glycerol which is trihydroxy propane. Many lipids have both glycerol and fatty acids. Here the fatty acids are found esteriﬁed with glycerol. They can be then monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides. These are also called fats and oils based on melting point. Oils have lower melting point (e. g., gingelly oil) and hence remain as oil in winters. Can you identify a fat from the market? Some lipids have phosphorous and a phosphorylated organic compound in them. These are phospholipids. They are found in cell membrane. Lecithin is one example. Some tissues especially the neural tissues have lipids with more complex structures. Living organisms have a number of carbon compounds in which heterocyclic rings can be found. Some of these are nitrogen bases — adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, and thymine. When found attached to a sugar, they are called nucleosides. If a phosphate group is also found esteriﬁed to the sugar they are called nucleotides. Adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, uridine and cytidine are nucleosides. Adenylic acid, thymidylic acid, guanylic acid, uridylic acid and cytidylic acid are nucleotides. Nucleic acids like DNA and RNA consist of nucleotides only. DNA and RNA function as genetic material."

When the name of the bank is written between two parallel lines, it becomes a special crossing and the payment can be made only to the bank whose name has been written between the two lines. Though this is rarely done, a cheque can be transferred by the payee (the person in whose favour the cheque has been drawn) to another person, if it is not crossed A/c payee only. A bearer cheque can be passed on by mere delivery. An order cheque can be transferred by endorsement and delivery. Endorsement means the writing of instructions to pay the cheque to a particular person and then singing it on the back of the cheque. Fig. 4.4 : Types of crossing When the number of bank transactions is large; it is convenient to have a separate amount column for bank transactions in the cash book itself instead of recording them in the journal. This helps in getting information about the position of the bank account from time to time. Just like cash transactions, all payments into the bank are recorded on the left side and all withdrawals / payments through the bank are recorded on the right side. When cash is deposited in the bank or cash is withdrawn from the bank, both the entries are recorded in the cash book. This is so because both aspects of the transaction appear in the cash book itself. When cash is paid into the bank, the amount deposited is written on the left side in the bank column and at the same time the same amount is entered on the right side in the cash column. The reverse entries are recorded when cash is withdrawn from the bank for use in the office. Against such entries the word C, which stands for contra is written in the L.F. column indicating that these entries are not to be posted to the ledger account. 2019-2020"

The same procedure can be used to resolve a general vector A into three components along x—, y-, and z—axes in three dimensions.

biology/,"156 Potential Energy Figure 9.6 Concept of activation energy BIOLOGY Transition state towards the ‘active site’. There is thus, an obligatory formation of an ‘ES’ complex. E ACtiVatiOfl energy stands for enzyme. This complex formation is a transient phenomenon. During the state where substrate is bound to the enzyme active site, a new structure of the substrate called energy with enzyme transition state structure is formed. Very soon, after the expected bond breaking/making is completed, the product is released from the active site. In other words, the structure of substrate gets transformed into the structure of product(s). The pathway of this transformation must go through the so-called PrOdUCt (P) transition state structure. There could be progress of reaction many more ‘altered structural states’ between the stable substrate and the product. Implicit in this statement is the fact that all other intermediate structural states are unstable. Stability is something related to energy status of the molecule or the structure. Hence, when we look at this pictorially through a graph it looks like something as in Figure 9.6. The y-axis represents the potential energy content. The x—axis represents the progression of the structural transformation or states through the ‘transition state’. You would notice two things. The energy level difference between S and P. If ‘P’ is at a lower level than ‘S’, the reaction is an exothermic reaction. One need not supply energy (by heating) in order to form the product. However, whether it is an exothermic or spontaneous reaction or an endothermic or energy requiring reaction, the ‘S’ has to go through a much higher energy state or transition state. The difference in average energy content of ‘S’ from that of this transition state is called ‘activation energy’. Enzymes eventually bring down this energy barrier making the transition of ‘S’ to ‘P’ more easy. 9.12.3 Nature of Enzyme Action Each enzyme (E) has a substrate (S) binding site in its molecule so that a highly reactive enzyme-substrate complex (ES) is produced. This complex is short-lived and dissociates into its product(s) P and the unchanged enzyme with an intermediate formation of the enzyme-product complex (EP). The formation of the ES complex is essential for catalysis."
biology/,"88 BIOLOGY and phloem ﬁbres. Gymnosperms have albuminous cells and sieve cells. They lack sieve tubes and companion cells. Sieve tube elements are also long, tube-like structures, arranged longitudinally and are associated with the companion cells. Their end walls are perforated in a sieve-like manner to form the sieve plates. A mature sieve element possesses a peripheral cytoplasm and a large vacuole but lacks a nucleus. The functions of sieve tubes are controlled by the nucleus of companion cells. The companion cells are specialised parenchymatous cells, which are closely associated with sieve tube elements. The sieve tube elements and companion cells are connected by pit ﬁelds present between their common longitudinal walls. The companion cells help in maintaining the pressure gradient in the sieve tubes. Phloem parenchyma is made up of elongated, tapering cylindrical cells which have dense cytoplasm and nucleus. The cell wall is composed of cellulose and has pits through which plasmodesmatal connections exist between the cells. The phloem parenchyma stores food material and other substances like resins, latex and mucilage. Phloem parenchyma is absent in most of the monocotyledons. Phloem fibres (bast fibres) are made up of sclerenchymatous cells. These are generally absent in the primary phloem but are found in the secondary phloem. These are much elongated, unbranched and have pointed, needle like apices. The cell wall of phloem ﬁbres is quite thick. At maturity, these ﬁbres lose their protoplasm and become dead. Phloem ﬁbres of jute, ﬂax and hemp are used commercially. The ﬁrst formed primary phloem consists of narrow sieve tubes and is referred to as protophloem and the later formed phloem has bigger sieve tubes and is referred to as metaphloem. 6.2 THE TISSUE SYSTEM We were discussing types of tissues based on the types of cells present. Let us now consider how tissues vary depending on their location in the plant body. Their structure and function would also be dependent on location. On the basis of their structure and location, there are three types of tissue systems. These are the epidermal tissue system, the ground or ﬁindamental tissue system and the vascular or conducting tissue system. 6.2. 1 Epidermal Tissue System The epidermal tissue system forms the outer-most covering of the whole plant body and comprises epidermal cells, stomata and the epidermal appendages — the trichomes and hairs.

physics/,"254 PHYSICS In the experiment it is found that the mercury column in the barometer has a height of about 76 cm at sea level equivalent to one atmosphere (1 atm). This can also be obtained using the value of p in Eq. (10.8). A common way of stating pressure is in terms of cm or m of mercury (Hg). A pressure equivalent of 1 mm is called a torr (after Torricelli). 1 torr = 133 Pa. The mm of Hg and torr are used in medicine and physiology. In meteorology, a common unit is the bar and millibar. 1 bar = 105 Pa An open tube manometer is a useful instrument for measuring pressure differences. It consists of a U-tube containing a suitable liquid i.e., a low density liquid (such as oil) for measuring small pressure differences and a high density liquid (such as mercury) for large pressure differences. One end of the tube is open to the atmosphere and the other end is connected to the system whose pressure we want to measure [see Fig. 10.5 (b)]. The pressure Pat A is equal to pressure at point B. What we normally measure is the gauge pressure, which is P—Pa, given by Eq. (10.8) and is proportional to manometer height h. Fig 1 0.5 (a) The mercury barometer. 2019-20 (b) The open tube manometer Fig 1 0.5 Two pressure measuring devices. Pressure is same at the same level on both sides of the U-tube containing a ﬂuid. For liquids, the density varies very little over wide ranges in pressure and temperature and we can treat it safely as a constant for our present purposes. Gases on the other hand, exhibits large variations of densities with changes in pressure and temperature. Unlike gases, liquids are, therefore, largely treated as incompressible. Example 10.3 The density of the atmosphere at sea level is 1.29 kg/m“. Assume that it does not change with altitude. Then how high would the atmosphere extend? AnswerWe use Eq. (10.7) pgh = 1.29kgm“3>< 9.8ms2x h m= 1.01>< 105Pa .-.h= 7989mz8km In reality the density of air decreases with height. So does the value of g. The atmospheric cover extends with decreasing pressure over 100 km. We should also note that the sea level atmospheric pressure is not always 760 mm of Hg. A drop in the Hg level by 10 mm or more is a sign of an approaching storm. 4 Example 1 0.4 At a depth of 1000 m in an ocean (a) what is the absolute pressure? (b) What is the gauge pressure?

geography/,"GEOGRAPHY AS A DISCIPLINE attempt synthesis over space. Maps are very effective tools of geographers in which the tabular data is converted into visual form to bring out the spatial pattern. BRANCHES OF GEOGRAPHY Please study Figure 1. 1 for recapitulation. It has very clearly brought out that geography is an interdisciplinary subject of study. The study of every subject is done according to some approach. The major approaches to study geography have been (i) Systematic and (ii) Regional. The systematic geography approach is the same as that of general geography. This approach was introduced by Alexander Von Humboldt, a German geographer (1769-1859) while regional geography approach was developed by another German geographer and a contemporary of Humboldt, Karl Ritter (1779- 1859). In systematic approach (Figure 1.2), a phenomenon is studied world over as a whole, and then the identification of typologies or spatial patterns is done. For example, if one is interested in studying natural vegetation, the study will be done at the world level as a first step. The typologies such as equatorial rain forests or softwood conical forests or monsoon forests, etc. will be identified, discussed and delimited. In the regional approach, the world is divided into regions at different hierarchical levels and then all the geographical phenomena in a particular region are studied. These regions may be natural, political or designated region. The phenomena in a region are studied in a holistic manner searching for unity in diversity. Dualism is one of the main characteristics of geography which got introduced from the very beginning. This dualism depended on the aspect emphasised in the study. Earlier scholars laid emphasis on physical geography. But human beings are an integral part of the earth’s surface. They are part and parcel of nature. They also have contributed through their cultural development. Thus developed human geography with emphasis on human activities. BRANCHES OF GEOGRAPHY (BASED ON SYSTEMATIC APPROACH) 1 . Physical Geography (i) Geomorphology is devoted to the study of landforms, their evolution and related processes. (ii) Climatology encompasses the study of structure of atmosphere and elements of weather and climates and climatic types and regions. (iii) Hydrology studies the realm of water over the surface of the earth including oceans, lakes, rivers and other water bodies and its effect on different life forms including human life and their activities. (iv) Soil Geography is devoted to study the processes of soil formation, soil types, their fertility status, distribution and use. 2. Human Geography (i) Social/ Cultural Geography encom- passes the study of society and its spatial dynamics as well as the cultural elements contributed by the society. (ii) Population and Settlement Geography (Rural and Urban). It studies population growth, distribution, density, sex ratio, migration and occupational structure etc. Settlement geography studies the characteristics of rural and urban settlements. (iii) Economic Geography studies economic activities of the people including agriculture, industry, tourism, trade, and transport, infrastructure and services, etc. (iv) Historical Geography studies the historical processes through which the space gets organised. Every region has undergone some historical experiences before attaining the present day status. The geographical features also experience temporal changes and these form the concerns of historical geography. 2019-2020"
biology/,"CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE Let us now look at individual cell organelles to understand their structure and functions. 8.5. 1 Cell Membrane The detailed structure of the membrane was studied only after the advent of the electron microscope in the 1950s. Meanwhile, chemical studies on the cell membrane, especially in human red blood cells (RBCs), enabled the scientists to deduce the possible structure of plasma membrane. These studies showed that the cell membrane is mainly composed of lipids and proteins. The major lipids are phospholipids that are arranged in a bilayer. Also, the lipids are arranged within the membrane with the polar head towards the outer sides and the hydrophobic tails towards the inner part.This ensures that the nonpolar tail of saturated hydrocarbons is protected from the aqueous environment (Figure 8.4). In addition to phospholipids membrane also contains cholesterol. Later, biochemical investigation clearly revealed that the cell membranes also possess protein and carbohydrate. The ratio of protein and lipid varies considerably in different cell types. In human beings, the membrane of the erythrocyte has approximately 52 per cent protein and 40 per cent lipids. Depending on the ease of extraction, membrane proteins can be classiﬁed as integral and peripheral. Peripheral proteins lie on the surface of membrane while the integral proteins are partially or totally buried in the membrane.

biology/,"PLANT KINGDOM The gymnosperms are heterosporous; they produce haploid microspores and megaspores. The two kinds of spores are produced within sporangia that are borne on sporophst which are arranged spirally along an axis to form lax or compact strobili or cones. ’Ihe strobili bearing microsporophylls and microsporangia are called microsporangiate or male strobili. The microspores develop into a male gametophytic generation which is highly reduced and is conﬁned to only a limited number of cells. This reduced gametophyte is called a pollen grain. The development of pollen grains take place within the microsporangia. The cones bearing megasporophylls with ovules or megasporangia are called macrosporangiate or female strobili. The male or female cones or strobili may be borne on the same tree (Pinus). However, in cycas male cones and megasporophst are bome on different trees. The megaspore mother cell is differentiated from one of the cells of the nucellus. The nucellus is protected by envelopes and the composite structure is called an ovule. ’Ihe ovules are borne on megasporophylls which may be clustered to form the female cones. The megaspore mother cell divides meiotically to form four megaspores. One of the megaspores enclosed within the megasporangium develops into a multicellular female gametophyte that bears two or more archegonia or female sex organs. The multicellular female gametophyte is also retained within megasporangium. Unlike bryophytes and pteridophytes, in gymnosperms the male and the female gametophytes do not have an independent free-living existence. They remain within the sporangia retained on the sporophytes. ’Ihe pollen grain is released from the microsporangium. They are carried in air currents and come in contact with the opening of the ovules borne on megasporophylls. The pollen tube carrying the male gametes grows towards archegonia in the ovules and discharge their contents near the mouth of the archegonia. Following fertilisation, zygote develops into an embryo and the ovules into seeds. These seeds are not covered. 201 9-2020 39 Long Shoot (C) Figure 3.4 Gymnosperms: (a) Cycas (b) Pinus (c) Ginkgo"
physics/,"UNITS AND MEASUREMENT test of consistency of units, but has the advantage that we need not commit ourselves to a particular choice of units, and we need not worry about conversions among multiples and sub-multiples of the units. It may be borne in mind that if an equation fails this consistency test, it is proved wrong, but if it passes, it is not proved right. Thus, a dimensionally correct equation need not be actually an exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong (incorrect) or inconsistent equation must be wrong. Example 2.1 5 Let us consider an equation 1 2 —mv =m h 2 9 where m is the mass of the body. L' its velocity. 9 is the acceleration due to gravity and It is the height. Check whether this equation is dimensionally correct. Answer The dimensions of LHS are [M] [L '1‘1 l2 = [M] [LZ'I‘2] = [M L2 T2] The dimensions of RHS are [MllL ""1‘21 [L] = [MllL2 ""1‘21 = [M L2'I‘2] The dimensions of LHS and RHS are the same and hence the equation is dimensionally correct. 4 Example 2.16 The SI unit of energy is J = kg m2 s”: that of speed 1) is m S’1 and of acceleration a is m S’Z. Which of the formulae for kinetic energy (K) given below can you rule out on the basis of dimensional arguments (m stands for the mass of the body) : (a) K = m2 U"" (b) K =(1/2)mv'-' (c) K = ma ((1) K = (3/16)mv'~’ (e) K= (1/2)mv”+ ma Answer Every correct formula or equation must have the same dimensions on both sides of the equation. Also, only quantities with the same physical dimensions can be added or subtracted. The dimensions of the quantity on the right side are [M2 L3 T3] for (a); [M L2 T2] for 33 (b) and (d); [M LT2] for (c). The quantity on the right side of (c) has no proper dimensions since two quantities of different dimensions have been added. Since the kinetic energy K has the dimensions of [M L2 T2], formulas (a), (c) and (e) are ruled out. Note that dimensional arguments cannot tell which of the two, (b) or (d), is the correct formula. For this, one must turn to the actual definition of kinetic energy (see Chapter 6). The correct formula for kinetic energy is given by (b). 4 2.10.2 Deducing Relation among the Physical Quantities The method of dimensions can sometimes be used to deduce relation among the physical quantities. For this we should know the dependence of the physical quantity on other quantities (upto three physical quantities or linearly independent variables) and consider it as a product type of the dependence. Let us take an example. Example 2.1 7 Consider a simple pendulum. having 3 bob attached to a string. that oscillates under the action of the force of gravity. Suppose that the period of oscillation of the simple pendulum depends on its length (1). mass of the bob (m) and acceleration due to gravity (g). Derive the expression for its time period using method of dimensions.

Phylum Chordata is divided into three subphyla: Urochordata or Tunicata, Cephalochordata and Vertebrata. Subphyla Urochordata and Cephalochordata are often referred to as protochordates (Figure 4.17) and are exclusively marine. In Urochordata, notochord is present only in larval tail, while in Cephalochordata, it extends from head to tail region and is persistent throughout their life. Examples: Urochordata — Ascidia, Salpa, Doliolum; Cephalochordata — Branchiostoma (Amphioxus or Lancelet). The members of subphylum Vertebrata possess notochord during the embryonic period. The notochord is replaced by a cartilaginous or bony vertebral column in the adult. Thus all vertebrates are chordates but all chordates are not vertebrates. Besides the basic chordate characters, vertebrates have a ventral muscular heart With two, three or four chambers, kidneys for excretion and osmoregulation and paired appendages which may be ﬁns or limbs.

physics/,"OSCILLATIONS 359 swings is a good example of resonance. You might have realised that the skill in swinging to greater heights lies in the synchronisation of the rhythm of pushing against the ground with the natural frequency of the swing. To illustrate this point further, let us consider a set of five simple pendulums of assorted lengths suspended from a common rope as shown in Fig. 14.22. The pendulums 1 and 4 have the same lengths and the others have different lengths. Now, let us set pendulum 1 into motion. The energy from this pendulum gets transferred to other pendulums through the connecting rope and they start oscillating. The driving force is provided through the connecting rope. The frequency of this force is the frequency with which pendulum 1 oscillates. If we observe the response of pendulums 2, 3 and 5, they first start oscillating with their natural frequencies of oscillations and different amplitudes, but this 5 Fig. 14.22 Five simple pendulums of different lengths suspended from a common support. motion is gradually damped and not sustained. Their frequencies of oscillation gradually change, and ultimately, they oscillate with the frequency of pendulum 1, i.e., the frequency of the driving force but with different amplitudes. They oscillate with small amplitudes. The response of pendulum 4 is in contrast to this set of pendulums. It oscillates with the same frequency as that of pendulum 1 and its amplitude gradually picks up and becomes very large. A resonance-like response is seen. This happens because in this the condition for resonance is satisfied, i.e. the natural frequency of the system coincides with that of the driving force. We have so far considered oscillating systems which have just one natural frequency. In general, a system may have several natural frequencies. You will see examples of such systems (vibrating strings, air columns, etc.) in the next chapter. Any mechanical structure, like a building, a bridge, or an aircraft may have several possible natural frequencies. An external periodic force or disturbance will set the system in forced oscillation. If, accidentally, the forced frequency cod happens to be close to one of the natural frequencies of the system, the amplitude of oscillation will shoot up (resonance), resulting in possible damage. This is why, soldiers go out of step while crossing a bridge. For the same reason, an earthquake will not cause uniform damage to all buildings in an affected area, even if they are built with the same strength and material. The natural frequencies of a building depend on its height, other size parameters, and the nature of building material. The one with its natural frequency close to the frequency of seismic wave is likely to be damaged more. SUMMARY 1. The motion that repeats itself is called periodic motion. 2.

biology/,"STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 7. 1 . 1 Epithelial Tissue We commonly refer to an epithelial tissue as epithelium (pl.: epithelia). This tissue has a free surface, which faces either a body ﬂuid or the outside environment and thus provides a covering or a lining for some part of the body. The cells are compactly packed with little intercellular matrix. There are two types of epithelial tissues namely simple epithelium and compound epithelium. Simple epithelium is composed of a single layer of cells and functions as a lining for body cavities, ducts, and tubes. The compound epithelium consists of two or more cell layers and has protective function as it does in our skin. On the basis of structural modiﬁcation of the cells, simple epithelium is further divided into three types. These are (i) Squamous, (ii) Cuboidal, (iii) Columnar (Figure 7 . 1). Figure 7.1 Simple epithelium: (a) Squamous (b) Cuboidal (c) Columnar (d) Columnar cells bearing cilia The squamous epithelium is made of a single thin layer of ﬂattened cells with irregular boundaries. They are found in the walls of blood vessels and air sacs of lungs and are involved in functions like forming a diffusion boundary. The cuboidal epithelium is composed of a single layer of cube-like cells. This is commonly found in ducts of glands and tubular parts of nephrons in kidneys and its main functions are secretion and absorption. The epithelium of proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) of nephron in the kidney has microvilli. The columnar epithelium is composed of a single layer of tall and slender cells. Their nuclei are located at the base. Free surface may have microvilli. They are found in the lining of stomach and intestine and help in secretion and absorption. If the columnar or cuboidal cells bear cilia on their free surface they are called ciliated epithelium (Figure 7 . 1d). Their function is to move particles or mucus in a speciﬁc direction over the epithelium. They are mainly present in the inner surface of hollow organs like bronchioles and fallopian tubes. 101"
biology/,"BIOMOLECULES Plant cell walls are made of cellulose. Paper made from plant pulp and cotton ﬁbre is cellulosic. There are more complex polysaccharides in nature. They have as building blocks, amino-sugars and chemically modified sugars (e. g., glucosamine, N-acetyl galactosamine, etc.). Exoskeletons of arthropods, for example, have a complex polysaccharide called chitin. These complex polysaccharides are mostly homopolymers. 9.6 NUCLEIC ACIDS The other type of macromolecule that one would find in the acid insoluble fraction of any living tissue is the nucleic acid. These are polynucleotides. Together with polysaccharides and polypeptides these comprise the true macromolecular fraction of any living tissue or cell. For nucleic acids, the building block is a nucleotide. A nucleotide has three chemically distinct components. One is a heterocyclic compound, the second is a monosaccharide and the third a phosphoric acid or phosphate. As you notice in Figure 9.1, the heterocyclic compounds in nucleic acids are the nitrogenous bases named adenine, guanine, uracil, cytosine, and thymine. Adenine and Guanine are substituted purines while the rest are substituted pyrimidines. The skeletal heterocyclic ring is called as purine and pyrimidine respectively. The sugar found in polynucleotides is either ribose (a monosaccharide pentose) or 2’ deoxyribose. A nucleic acid containing deoxyribose is called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) while that which contains ribose is called ribonucleic acid (RNA). 9.7 STRUCTURE OF PROTEINS Proteins, as mentioned earlier, are heteropolymers containing strings of amino acids. Structure of molecules means different things in different contexts. In inorganic chemistry, the structure invariably refers to the molecular formulae (e.g., NaCl, MgClZ, etc.). Organic chemists always write a two dimensional view of the molecules while representing the structure of the molecules (e.g., benzene, naphthalene, etc.). Physicists conjure up the three dimensional views of molecular structures while biologists describe the protein structure at four levels. The sequence of amino acids i.e., the positional information in a protein — which is the first amino acid, which is second, and so on — is called the primary structure (Figure 9.3) of a protein. A protein is imagined as a line, the left end represented by the first amino acid and the right end represented by the last amino 149"
biology/,"BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASES 17 . 1 . 1 Human Respiratory System We have a pair of external nostrils opening out above the upper lips. It leads to a nasal chamber through the nasal passage. The nasal chamber opens into the pharynx, a portion of which is the common passage for food and air. The pharynx opens through the larynx region into the trachea. Larynx is a cartilaginous box which helps in sound production and hence called the sound box. During swallowing glottis can be covered by a thin elastic cartilaginous ﬂap called epiglottis to prevent the entry of food into the larynx. Trachea is a straight tube extending up to the mid-thoracic cavity, which divides at the level of 5th thoracic vertebra into a right and left primaly bronchi. Each bronchi undergoes repeated divisions to form the secondary and tertiary bronchi and bronchioles ending up in very thin terminal bronchioles. The tracheae, primary, secondary and tertiary bronchi, and initial bronchioles are supported by incomplete cartilaginous rings. Each terminal bronchiole gives rise to a number of very thin, irregular-walled and vascularised bag-like structures called alveoli. The branching network of bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli comprise the lungs (Figure 17 . 1). We have two lungs which are covered by a double layered pleura, with pleural ﬂuid between them. It reduces friction on the lung-surface.

Also, the waste or harmful substances produced, have to be removed continuously for healthy functioning of tissues. It is therefore, essential to have efficient mechanisms for the movement of these substances to the cells and from the cells. Different groups of animals have evolved different methods for this transport. Simple organisms like sponges and coelenterates circulate water from their surroundings through their body cavities to facilitate the cells to exchange these substances. More complex organisms use special ﬂuids Within their bodies to transport such materials. Blood is the most commonly used body ﬂuid by most of the higher organisms including humans for this purpose. Another body ﬂuid, lymph, also helps in the transport of certain substances. In this chapter, you Will learn about the composition and properties of blood and lymph (tissue ﬂuid) and the mechanism of circulation of blood is also explained herein. 18. l BLOOD Blood is a special connective tissue consisting of a ﬂuid matrix, plasma, and formed elements. 18. 1. 1 Plasma Plasma is a straw coloured, viscous ﬂuid constituting nearly 55 per cent of the blood. 90-92 per cent of plasma is water and proteins contribute 6-8 per cent of it.

Hydroponics has been successfully employed as a technique for the commercial production of vegetables such as tomato, seedless cucumber and lettuce. It must be emphasised that the nutrient solutions must be adequately aerated to obtain the optimum growth. What would happen if solutions were poorly aerated? Diagrammatic views of the hydroponic technique is given in Figures 12.1 and 12.2. 12.2 ESSENTIAL MINERAL ELEMENTS Most of the minerals present in soil can enter plants through roots. In fact, more than sixty elements of the 105 discovered so far are found in different plants. Some plant species accumulate selenium, some others gold, while some plants growing near nuclear test sites take up radioactive strontium. There are techniques that are able to detect the minerals even at a very low concentration (10‘8 g/ mL). The question is, whether all the diverse mineral elements present in a plant, for example, gold and selenium as mentioned above, are really necessary for plants? How do we decide what is essential for plants and what is not? 12.2. 1 Criteria for Essentiality The criteria for essentiality of an element are given below: (a) The element must be absolutely necessary for supporting normal growth and reproduction. In the absence of the element the plants do not complete their life cycle or set the seeds. (b) The requirement of the element must be speciﬁc and not replaceable by another element. In other words, deﬁciency of any one element cannot be met by supplying some other element. (c) The element must be directly involved in the metabolism of the plant. 195 Funnel for adding water and nutrients [1, Figure 12.1 Diagram of a typical set-up for nutrient solution culture Nutrient Figure 12.2 Hydroponic plant production.

For example, Fig. 10.8(a) describes a laminar ﬂow where the velocities at different points in the fluid may have different magnitudes but their directions are parallel. Figure 10.8 (b) gives a sketch of turbulent ﬂow. (a) (b) Fig. 10.8 (a) Some streamlines for ﬂuid ﬂow. (b) A jet of air striking a ﬂat plate placed perpendicular to it. This is an example of turbulent ﬂow. 10.4 BERNOULLI'S PRINCIPLE Fluid ﬂow is a complex phenomenon. But we can obtain some useful properties for steady or streamline ﬂows using the conservation of energy. Consider a ﬂuid moving in a pipe of varying cross-sectional area. Let the pipe be at varying heights as shown in Fig. 10.9. We now suppose that an incompressible ﬂuid is ﬂowing through the pipe in a steady ﬂow. Its velocity must change as a consequence of equation of continuity. A force is required to produce this acceleration, which is caused by the ﬂuid surrounding it, the pressure must be different in different regions. Bernoulli’s equation is a general expression that relates the pressure difference between two points in a pipe to both velocity changes (kinetic energy change) and elevation (height) changes (potential energy Daniel Bernoulli (1 700 —1 782) change). The Swiss Physicist Daniel Bernoulli developed this relationship in 1738. Consider the ﬂow at two regions 1 (i.e., BC) and 2 (i.e., DE). Consider the ﬂuid initially lying between B and D. In an infinitesimal time interval At, this ﬂuid would have moved. Suppose U1 is the speed at B and v2 at D, then ﬂuid initially at B has moved a distance let to C (let is small enough to assume constant cross-section along BC). In the same interval At the ﬂuid initially at D moves to E, a distance equal to v2At. Pressures P1 and P2 act as shown on the plane faces of areas A1 and A2 binding the two regions. The work done on the ﬂuid at left end (BC) is W1 = P1A1(v1At) = PIAV. Since the same volume AV passes through both the regions (from the equation of continuity) the work done by the ﬂuid at the other end (DE) is W2 = P2A2(v2At) = P2AVor, the work done on the ﬂuid is —P2AV. So the total work done on the ﬂuid is W1 — W2 = (Pl—P2) AV Part of this work goes into changing the kinetic energy of the ﬂuid, and part goes into changing the gravitational potential energy. If the density of the ﬂuid is p and Am = pAllet = pAV is the mass passing through the pipe in time At, then change in gravitational potential energy is AU = pgAV (hZ—hl) The change in its kinetic energy is AK = p AV (1122—012) We can employ the work — energy theorem (Chapter 6) to this volume of the ﬂuid and this yields 1 (Pl—P2) AV= (E) p AV(v22 —v12) + pgAV (h2—h1) We now divide each term by AVto obtain 1 (Ia—P2) = [5) P (vi-v.21 + pg (re—h.)

biology/,"TRANSPORT IN PLANTS 187 rates, up to l 5 metres per hour. How is this movement accomplished? A long standing question is, whether water is ‘pushed’ or ‘pulled’ through the plant. Most researchers agree that water is mainly ‘pulled’ through the plant, and that the driving force for this process is transpiration from the leaves. This is referred to as the cohesion-tension-transpiration pull model of water transport. But, what generates this transpirational pull? Water is transient in plants. Less than 1 per cent of the water reaching the leaves is used in photosynthesis and plant growth. Most of it is lost through the stomata in the leaves. This water loss is known as transpiration. You have studied transpiration in an earlier class by enclosing a healthy plant in polythene bag and observing the droplets of water formed inside the bag. You could also study water loss from a leaf using cobalt chloride paper, which turns colour on absorbing water. 1 1 .4 TRANSPIRATION Transpiration is the evaporative loss of water by plants. It occurs mainly through stomata (sing. : stoma). Besides the loss of water vapour in transpiration, exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the leaf also occurs through these stomata. Normally stomata are open in the day time and close during the night. The immediate cause of the opening or closing of stomata is a change in the turgidity of the guard cells. The inner wall of each guard cell, towards the pore or stomatal aperture, is thick and elastic. When turgidity increases within the two guard cells ﬂanking each stomatal aperture or pore, the thin outer walls bulge out and force the inner walls into a crescent shape. The opening of the stoma is also aided due to the orientation of the microfibrils in the cell walls of the guard cells. Cellulose rnicrofibrils are oriented radially rather than longitudinally making it easier for the stoma to open. When the guard cells lose turgor, due to water loss (or water stress) the elastic inner walls regain their original shape, the guard cells become ﬂaccid and the stoma closes. Usually the lower surface of a dorsiventral (often dicotyledonous) leaf has a greater number of stomata while in an isobilateral (often monocotyledonous) leaf they are about equal on both surfaces. Transpiration is affected by several external factors: temperature, light, MiCFOﬁbn'lS humidity, wind speed. Plant factors that Guard cell affect transpiration include number and distribution of stomata, per cent of open stomata, water status of the plant, canopy structure etc. Stomatal aperture Figure11.8 A stomatal aperture with guard cells 2019-2020"

These substances have to be removed totally or partially. In this chapter, you will learn the mechanisms of elimination of these substances with special emphasis on common nitrogenous wastes. Ammonia, urea and uric acid are the major forms of nitrogenous wastes excreted by the animals. Ammonia is the most toxic form and requires large amount of water for its elimination, whereas uric acid, being the least toxic, can be removed with a minimum loss of water. The process of excreting ammonia is Ammonotelism Many bony ﬁshes, aquatic amphibians and aquatic insects are ammonotelic in nature. Ammonia, as it is readily soluble, is generally excreted by diffusion across body surfaces or through gill surfaces (in ﬁsh) as ammonium ions. Kidneys do not play any significant role in its removal. Terrestrial adaptation necessitated the production of lesser toxic nitrogenous wastes like urea and uric acid for conservation of water. Mammals, many terrestrial amphibians and marine fishes mainly excrete urea and are called ureotelic animals. Ammonia produced by metabolism is converted into urea in the liver of these animals and released into the blood which is filtered and excreted out by the kidneys. Some amount of urea may be retained in the kidney matrix of some of these animals to maintain a desired osmolarity. Reptiles, birds, land snails and insects excrete nitrogenous wastes as uric acid in the form of pellet or paste with a minimum loss of water and are called uricotelic animals. 2019-2020"

(In fact, since you are aware that you are moving, these distant objects seem to move with you]. . 19 The principle of ‘parallax’ in section 2.3.1 is used in the determination of distances of very distant stars. The baseline AB is the line joining the Earth's two locations six months apart in its orbit around the Sun. That is, the baseline is about the diameter of the Earth’s orbit z 3 x 1011m. However, even the nearest stars are so distant that with such a long baseline, they show parallax only of the order of 1” (second) of arc or so. A parsec is a convenient unit of length on the astronomical scale. It is the distance of an object that will show a parallax of 1"" [second of arc] from opposite ends of a baseline equal to the distance from the Earth to the Sun.

The Coriolis force is directly proportional to the angle of latitude. It is maximum at the poles and is absent at the equator. The Coriolis force acts perpendicular to the pressure gradient force. The pressure gradient force is perpendicular to an isobar. The higher the pressure gradient force, the more is the velocity of the wind and the larger is the deﬂection in the direction of wind. As a result of these two forces operating perpendicular to each other, in the low-pressure areas the wind blows around it. At the equator, the Coriolis force is zero and the wind blows perpendicular to the isobars. The low pressure gets filled instead of getting intensiﬁed. That is the reason why tropical cyclones are not formed near the equator. Pressure and Wind The velocity and direction of the wind are the net result of the wind generating forces. The winds in the upper atmosphere, 2 - 3 km above the surface, are free from frictional effect of the surface and are controlled mainly by the pressure gradient and the Coriolis force. When isobars are straight and when there is no friction, the pressure gradient force is balanced by the Coriolis force and the resultant wind blows parallel to the isobar. This wind is known as the geostrophic wind (Figure 10.4).

Around a high it is called anti cyclonic circulation. The direction of winds around such systems changes according to their location in different hemispheres (Table 10.2). The wind circulation at the earth’s surface around low and high on many occasions is closely related to the wind circulation at higher level. Generally, over low pressure area the air will converge and rise. Over high pressure area the air will subside from above and diverge at the surface (Figure 1 0.5). Apart from convergence, some eddies, convection currents, orographic uplift and uplift along fronts cause the rising of air, which is essential for the formation of clouds and precipitation.

geography/,"ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION AND WEATHER SYSTEMS Land and Sea Breezes As explained earlier, the land and sea absorb and transfer heat differently. During the day the land heats up faster and becomes warmer than the sea. Therefore, over the land the air rises giving rise to a low pressure area, whereas the sea is relatively cool and the pressure over sea is relatively high. Thus, pressure gradient from sea to land is created and the wind blows from the sea to the land as the sea breeze. In the night the reversal of condition takes place. The land loses heat faster and is cooler than the sea. The pressure gradient is from the land to the sea and hence land breeze results (Figure 10.7). Sea Breeze Land Breeze Figure 10.7 ; Land and sea breezes Mountain and Valley Winds In mountainous regions, during the day the slopes get heated up and air moves upslope and to fill the resulting gap the air from the valley blows up the valley. This wind is known 89 as the valley breeze. During the night the slopes get cooled and the dense air descends into the valley as the mountain wind. The cool air, of the high plateaus and ice fields draining into the valley is called katabatic wind. Another type of warm wind occurs on the leeward side of the mountain ranges. The moisture in these winds, while crossing the mountain ranges condense and precipitate. When it descends down the leeward side of the slope the dry air gets warmed up by adiabatic process. This dry air may melt the snow in a short time. Air Masses When the air remains over a homogenous area for a sufficiently longer time, it acquires the characteristics of the area. The homogenous regions can be the vast ocean surface or vast plains. The air with distinctive characteristics in terms of temperature and humidity is called an airmass. It is defined as a large body of air having little horizontal variation in temperature and moisture. The homogenous surfaces, over which air masses form, are called the source regions. The air masses are classified according to the source regions. There are five major source regions. These are: (i) Warm tropical and subtropical oceans; (ii) The subtropical hot deserts; (iii) The relatively cold high latitude oceans; (iv) The very cold snow covered continents in high latitudes; (v) Permanently ice covered continents in the Arctic and Antarctica. Accordingly, following types of air- masses are recognised: (i) Maritime tropical (mT); (ii) Continental tropical (cT); (iii) Maritime polar (mP); (iv) Continental polar (cP); (v) Continental arctic (cA). Tropical air masses are warm and polar air masses are cold. Fronts When two different air masses meet, the boundary zone between them is called a front. The process of formation of the fronts is known as frontogenesis. There are four types of fronts: (a) Cold; (b) Warm; (c) Stationary; (d) Occluded. When the front remains stationary, it is called a stationary front. When the cold air moves 2019-2020"

It implies that if the sum of all debits equals the sum of all credits, it is presumed that the posting to the ledger in terms of debit and credit amounts is accurate. The trial balance is a tool for verifying the correctness of debit and credit amounts. It is an arithmetical check under the double entry system which veriﬁes that both aspects of every transaction have been recorded accurately. This chapter explains the meaning and process of preparation of trial balance and the types of errors and their rectification. 6.1 Meaning of Trial Balance A trial balance is a statement showing the balances, or total of debits and credits, of all the accounts in the ledger with a view to verify the arithmatical accuracy of posting into the ledger accounts. Trial balance is an important statement in the accounting process as it shows the final position of all accounts and helps in preparing the final statements. The task of preparing the statements is simplified because the accountant can take the balances of all accounts from the trial balance instead of going through the whole ledger. It may be noted that the trial balance is usually prepared with the balances of accounts. 2019-2020"

When two or more waves traverse simultaneously in the same medium, the displacement of any element of the medium is the algebraic sum of the displacements due to each wave. This is known as the principle of superposition of waves y=ifi(x — vt) Two sinusoidal waves on the same string exhibit interference, adding or cancelling according to the principle of superposition. If the two are travelling in the same direction and have the same amplitude a and frequency but differ in phase by a phase constant (1), the result is a single wave with the same frequency (0: _ 1 . 1 le, t) - [Zacosiqb] sm(kx—wt +E¢j If (1) = 0 or an integral multiple of 271', the waves are exactly in phase and the interference is constructive; if q) = 7:, they are exactly out of phase and the interference is destructive. A travelling wave, at a rigid boundary or a closed end, is reﬂected with a phase reversal but the reﬂection at an open boundary takes place without any phase change. For an incident wave yi[x, t) = asin [kx— cot] the reﬂected wave at a rigid boundary is y,(X. t] = — asin [kx+ cot) For reﬂection at an open boundary yr(x,t) = asin (kx+ cat) The interference of two identical waves moving in opposite directions produces standing waves. For a string with fixed ends, the standing wave is given by y[x, t) = [2a sin kx] cos cot Standing waves are characterised by fixed locations of zero displacement called nodes and fixed locations of maximum displacements called antinodes. The separation between two consecutive nodes or antinodes is M 2. A stretched string of length L fixed at both the ends vibrates with frequencies given by n v 2 L ’ The set of frequencies given by the above relation are called the normal modes of osciﬂation of the system.

The major components of our food are carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Vitamins and minerals are also required in small quantities. Food provides energy and organic materials for growth and repair of tissues. The water we take in, plays an important role in metabolic processes and also prevents dehydration of the body. Biomacromolecules in food cannot be utilised by our body in their original form. They have to be broken down and converted into simple substances in the digestive system. This process of conversion of complex food substances to simple absorbable forms is called digestion and is carried out by our digestive system by mechanical and biochemical methods. General organisation of the human digestive system is shown in Figure 16.1. 16. 1 DIGESTIVE SYSTEM The human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and the associated glands. 16. 1. l Alimentary Canal The alimentary canal begins with an anterior opening — the mouth, and it opens out posteriorly through the anus. The mouth leads to the buccal cavity or oral cavity. The oral cavity has a number of teeth and a muscular tongue. Each tooth is embedded in a socket of jaw bone (Figure16.2). This type of attachment is called thecodont. Majority of mammals including human being forms two sets of teeth during their life, a set of temporary milk or deciduous teeth replaced by a set of permanent or adult teeth. This type of dentition is called diphyodont. An adult human 2019-2020"

These modiﬁcations increase the surface area enormously. Villi are supplied with a network of capillaries and a large lymph vessel called the lacteal. Mucosal epithelium has goblet cells which secrete mucus that help in lubrication. Mucosa also forms glands in the stomach (gastric glands) and crypts in between the bases of villi in the intestine (crypts of Lieberkuhn). All the four layers show modiﬁcations in different parts of the alimentary canal. 16. 1 .2 Digestive Glands The digestive glands associated with the alimentary canal include the salivary glands, the liver and the pancreas. Saliva is mainly produced by three pairs of salivary glands, the parotids (cheek), the sub- maxillary/sub-mandibular (lower jaw) and the sub- linguals (below the tongue). These glands situated just outside the buccal cavity secrete salivary juice into the buccal cavity. Liver is the largest gland of the body weighing about 1.2 to 1.5 kg in an adult human. It is situated in the abdominal cavity, just below the diaphragm and has two lobes. The hepatic lobules are the structural and functional units of liver containing hepatic cells arranged in the form of cords. Each lobule is covered by a thin connective tissue sheath called the Glisson’s capsule.

For example, the dimensional equations of volume [V], speed [1)], force [F] and mass density [p] may be expressed as [V] = [M0 L310] [v1 = [M0 LTI] [F] = [M LTZ] [p1 = [M L-3 T0] The dimensional equation can be obtained from the equation representing the relations between the physical quantities. The dimensional formulae of a large number and wide variety of physical quantities, derived from the equations representing the relationships among other physical quantities and expressed in terms of base quantities are given in Appendix 9 for your guidance and ready reference. 2.10 DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS AND ITS APPLICATIONS The recognition of concepts of dimensions, which guide the description of physical behaviour is of basic importance as only those physical quantities can be added or subtracted which have the same dimensions. A thorough understanding of dimensional analysis helps us in deducing certain relations among different physical quantities and checking the derivation, accuracy and dimensional consistency or homogeneity of various mathematical expressions. When magnitudes of two or more physical quantities are multiplied, their units should be treated in the same manner as ordinary algebraic symbols. We can cancel identical units in the numerator and denominator. The same is true for dimensions of a physical quantity. Similarly, physical quantities represented by symbols on both sides of a mathematical equation must have the same dimensions. 2.10.1 Checking the Dimensional Consistency of Equations The magnitudes of physical quantities may be added together or subtracted from one another only if they have the same dimensions. In other words, we can add or subtract similar physical quantities. Thus, velocity cannot be added to force, or an electric current cannot be subtracted 2019-20 from the thermodynamic temperature. This simple principle called the principle of homogeneity of dimensions in an equation is extremely useful in checking the correctness of an equation. If the dimensions of all the terms are not same, the equation is wrong. Hence, if we derive an expression for the length (or distance) of an object, regardless of the symbols appearing in the original mathematical relation, when all the individual dimensions are simplified, the remaining dimension must be that of length. Similarly, if we derive an equation of speed, the dimensions on both the sides of equation, when simplified, must be of length/ time, or [L T1]. Dimensions are customarily used as a preliminary test of the consistency of an equation, when there is some doubt about the correctness of the equation. However, the dimensional consistency does not guarantee correct equations. It is uncertain to the extent of dimensionless quantities or functions. The arguments of special functions, such as the trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential functions must be dimensionless. A pure number, ratio of similar physical quantities, such as angle as the ratio (length/length), refractive index as the ratio (speed of light in vacuum / speed of light in medium) etc., has no dimensions. Now we can test the dimensional consistency or homogeneity of the equation x=x0 +v0 t+(l/2)at2 for the distance x travelled by a particle or body in time twhich starts from the position x0 with an initial velocity Do at time t= O and has uniform acceleration a along the direction of motion.

physics/,"4 2 PHYSICS Now, let us consider the motion of a car that starts from rest at time t= O s from the origin 0 and picks up speed till t = 10 s and thereafter moves with uniform speed till t = 18 s. Then the brakes are applied and the car stops at t= 20 s and x= 296 m. The position-time graph for this case is shown in Fig. 3.3. We shall refer to this graph in our discussion in the following sections. 3.3 AVERAGE VELOCITY AND AVERAGE SPEED When an object is in motion, its position changes with time. But how fast is the position changing with time and in what direction? To describe this, we define the quantity average velocity. Average velocity is defined as the change in position or displacement (Ax) divided by the time intervals (At), in which the displacement occurs : x2 — x1 Ax (31) l): :— tZ—tl At where x2 and x1 are the positions of the object at time t2and t1, respectively. Here the bar over the symbol for velocity is a standard notation used to indicate an average quantity. The SI unit for velocity is m / s or In 8—1, although km h‘1 is used in many everyday applications. Like displacement, average velocity is also a vector quantity. But as explained earlier, for motion in a straight line, the directional aspect of the vector can be taken care of by + and — signs and we do not have to use the vector notation for velocity in this chapter. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 t (s) —+ Fig. 3.4 The average velocity is the slope of line P1P2' 2019-20 Consider the motion of the car in Fig. 3.3.

The average velocity can be positive or negative depending upon the sign of the displacement. It is zero if the displacement is zero.

We have seen earlier that the magnitude of displacement may be different from the actual path length. To describe the rate of motion over the actual path, we introduce another quantity called average speed. Average speed is defined as the total path length travelled divided by the total time interval during which the motion has taken place : Total path length Average speed 2 — (32) Total time interval Average speed has obviously the same unit (m s4) as that of velocity. But it does not tell us in what direction an object is moving. Thus, it is always positive (in contrast to the average velocity which can be positive or negative). If the motion of an object is along a straight line and in the same direction, the magnitude of displacement is equal to the total path length. In that case, the magnitude of average velocity"

biology/,"24 BIOLOGY is branched and septate. The asexual spores are conidia produced exogenously on the special mycelium called conidiophores. Conidia on germination produce mycelium. Sexual spores are called ascospores which are produced endogenously in sac like asci (singular ascus). These asci are arranged in different types of fruiting bodies called ascocarps. Some examples are Aspergillus Wigure 2.5b), Claviceps and Neurospora. Neurospora is used extensively in biochemical and genetic work. Many members like morels and trufﬂes are edible and are considered delicacies. 2.3.3 Basidiomycetes Commonly known forms of basidiomycetes are mushrooms, bracket fungi or puffballs. They grow in soil, on logs and tree stumps and in living plant bodies as parasites, e. g., rusts and smuts. The mycelium is branched and septate. The asexual spores are generally not found, but vegetative reproduction by fragmentation is common. The sex organs are absent, but plasmogamy is brought about by fusion of two vegetative or somatic cells of different strains or genotypes. The resultant structure is dikaryotic which ultimately gives rise to basidium. Karyogamy and meiosis take place in the basidium producing four basidiospores. The basidiospores are exogenously produced on the basidium (pl.: basidia). The basidia are arranged in fruiting bodies called basidiocarps. Some common members are Agaricus (mushroom) (Figure 2.50), Ustilago (smut) and Puccinia (rust fungus). 2.3.4 Deuteromycetes Commonly known as imperfect fungi because only the asexual or vegetative phases of these fungi are known. When the sexual forms of these fungi were discovered they were moved into classes they rightly belong to. It is also possible that the asexual and vegetative stage have been given one name (and placed under deuteromycetes) and the sexual stage another (and placed under another class). Later when the linkages were established, the fungi were correctly identified and moved out of deuteromycetes. Once perfect (sexual) stages of members of dueteromycetes were discovered they were often moved to ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. The deuteromycetes reproduce only by asexual spores known as conidia. The mycelium is septate and branched. Some members are saprophytes or parasites while a large number of them are decomposers of litter and help in mineral cycling. Some examples are Alternaria, Colletotrichum and Trichoderma."
geography/,"WATER IN THE ATMOSPHERE the temperature of the air is reduced to dew point with its volume remaining constant; (ii) when both the volume and the temperature are reduced; (iv) when moisture is added to the air through evaporation. However, the most favourable condition for condensation is the decrease in air temperature. After condensation the water vapour or the moisture in the atmosphere takes one of the following forms — dew, frost, fog and clouds. Forms of condensation can be classiﬁed on the basis of temperature and location. Condensation takes place when the dew point is lower than the freezing point as well as higher than the freezing point. Dew When the moisture is deposited in the form of water droplets on cooler surfaces of solid objects (rather than nuclei in air above the surface) such as stones, grass blades and plant leaves, it is known as dew. The ideal conditions for its formation are clear sky, calm air, high relative humidity, and cold and long nights. For the formation of dew, it is necessary that the dew point is above the freezing point. Frost Frost forms on cold surfaces when condensation takes place below freezing point (0°C), i.e. the dew point is at or below the freezing point. The excess moisture is deposited in the form of minute ice crystals instead of water droplets. The ideal conditions for the formation of white frost are the same as those for the formation of dew, except that the air temperature must be at or below the freezing point. Fog and Mist When the temperature of an air mass containing a large quantity of water vapour falls all of a sudden, condensation takes place within itself on ﬁne dust particles. So, the fog is a cloud with its base at or very near to the ground. Because of the fog and mist, the visibility becomes poor to zero. In urban and industrial centres smoke provides plenty of nuclei which help the formation of fog and mist. Such a 95 condition when fog is mixed with smoke, is described as smog. The only difference between the mist and fog is that mist contains more moisture than the fog. In mist each nuceli contains a thicker layer of moisture. Mists are frequent over mountains as the rising warm air up the slopes meets a cold surface. Fogs are drier than mist and they are prevalent where warm currents of air come in contact with cold currents. Fogs are mini clouds in which condensation takes place around nuclei provided by the dust, smoke, and the salt particles. Clouds Cloud is a mass of minute water droplets or tiny crystals of ice formed by the condensation of the water vapour in free air at considerable elevations. As the clouds are formed at some height over the surface of the earth, they take various shapes. According to their height, expanse, density and transparency or opaqueness clouds are grouped under four types 2 (i) cirrus; (ii) cumulus; (iii) stratus; (iv) nimbus. Cirrus Cirrus clouds are formed at high altitudes (8,000 - 12,000m). They are thin and detatched clouds having a feathery appearance. They are always white in colour. Cumulus Cumulus clouds look like cotton wool. They are generally formed at a height of 4,000 - 7,000 m. They exist in patches and can be seen scattered here and there. They have a ﬂat base. Stratus As their name implies, these are layered clouds covering large portions of the sky. These clouds are generally formed either due to loss of heat or the mixing of air masses with different temperatures. Nimbus Nimbus clouds are black or dark gray. They form at middle levels or very near to the surface 2019-2020"

These may vary from the size of the order of 10'14 m of the tiny nucleus of an atom to the size of the order of 1026 m of the extent of the observable universe. Table 2.3 gives the range and order of lengths and sizes of some of these objects. We also use certain special length units for short and large lengths. These are 1 fermi = 1 f= 10'15 m 1 angstrom = 1 A = 10'10 m 1 astronomical unit = 1 AU (average distance of the Sun from the Earth) = 1.496x 1011 m 1 light year = 1 ly= 9.46 x 1015 m (distance that light travels with velocity of 3 x 108 m S'1 in 1 year) 1 parsec = 3.08 x 1016 m (Parsec is the distance at which average radius of earth’s orbit subtends an angle of 1 arc second) 2.4 MEASUREMENT OF MASS Mass is a basic property of matter. It does not depend on the temperature, pressure or location of the object in space. The SI unit of mass is kilogram (kg). The prototypes of the International standard kilogram supplied by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) are available in many other laboratories of different countries. In India, this is available at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi. While dealing with atoms and molecules, the kilogram is an inconvenient unit. In this case, there is an important standard unit of mass, called the unified atomic mass unit (u), which has been established for expressing the mass of atoms as 1 unified atomic mass unit = 1u = (1 / 12) of the mass of an atom of carbon- 12 isotope (1: C) including the mass of electrons = 1.66 X 10—27 kg Mass of commonly available objects can be determined by a common balance like the one used in a grocery shop. Large masses in the universe like planets, stars, etc., based on Newton’s law of gravitation can be measured by using gravitational method (See Chapter 8). For measurement of small masses of atomic/sub- atomic particles etc., we make use of mass spectrograph in which radius of the trajectory is proportional to the mass of a charged particle moving in uniform electric and magnetic field. 2.4.1 Range of Masses The masses of the objects, we come across in the universe, vary over a very wide range.

It allows to find the moment of inertia of a body about any axis, given the moment of inertia of the body about a parallel axis through the centre of mass of the body. We shall only state this theorem and not give its proof. We shall, however, apply it to a few simple situations which will be enough to convince us about the usefulness of the theorem. The theorem may be stated as follows: The moment of inertia of a body about any axis is equal to the sum of the moment of inertia of the body about a parallel axis passing through its centre of mass and the product of its mass and the square of the distance between the two parallel axes. As shown in the Fig. 7.31, z and z’ are two parallel axes, separated by a distance a. The z-axis passes through the centre of mass 0 of the rigid body. Then according to the theorem of parallel axes IZ,=IZ+ Ma2 (7.37) where 12 and I2, are the moments of inertia of the body about the z and z’axes respectively, M is the total mass of the body and a is the perpendicular distance between the two parallel axes. > Example 7.11 What is the moment of inertia of a rod of mass M. length I about an axis perpendicular to it through one end?

For example, the angular velocity 0) plays the same role in rotation as the linear velocity v in translation. We wish to take this analogy further. In doing so we shall restrict the discussion only to rotation about fixed axis. This case of motion involves only one degree of freedom, i.e., needs only one independent variable to describe the motion. This in translation corresponds to linear motion. This section is limited only to kinematics. We shall turn to dynamics in later sections. We recall that for specifying the angular displacement of the rotating body we take any particle like P (Fig.7 .33) of the body. Its angular displacement 6 in the plane it moves is the angular displacement of the whole body; 0 is measured from a fixed direction in the plane of motion of P, which we take to be the x’-axis, chosen parallel to the x-axis. Note, as shown, the axis of rotation is the z — axis and the plane of the motion of the particle is the x - y plane. Fig. 7.33 also shows 00, the angular displacement at t= 0. We also recall that the angular velocity is the time rate of change of angular displacement, a) = dO/dt. Note since the axis of rotation is fixed, 2019-20"
geography/,"LIFE ON THE EARTH The producers are consumed by the primary consumers whereas the primary consumers are, in turn, being eaten by the secondary consumers. Further, the secondary consumers are consumed by the tertiary consumers. The decomposers feed on the dead at each and every level. They change them into various substances such as nutrients, organic and inorganic salts essential for soil fertility. Organisms of an ecosystem are linked together through a foodchain (Figure 15.1). For example, a plant eating beetle feeding on a paddy stalk is eaten by a frog, which is, in turn, eaten by a snake, which is then consumed by a hawk. This sequence of eating and being eaten and the resultant transfer of energy from one level to another is known as the food-chain. Transfer of energy that occurs during the process of a foodchain from one level to another is known as ﬂow of energy. However, food-chains are not isolated from one another. For example, a mouse feeding on grain may be eaten by different secondary consumers (carnivores) and these carnivores may be eaten by other different tertiary consumers (top carnivores). In such situations, each of the carnivores may consume more than one type of prey. As a result, the food- chains get interlocked with one another. This inter- connecting network of species is known as food web. Generally, two types of food-chains are recognised: grazing food-chain and detritus food-chain. In a grazing food-chain, the first level starts with plants as producers and ends with carnivores as consumers at the last level, with the herbivores being at the intermediate level. There is a loss of energy at each level which may be through respiration, excretion or decomposition. The levels involved in a food- chain range between three to ﬁve and energy is lost at each level. A detritus food-chain is based on autotrophs energy capture initiated by grazing animals and involves the decomposition or breaking down of organic wastes and dead matter derived from the grazing food-chain. Types of Biomes In the earlier paragraphs, you have learnt the meaning of the term ‘biome’. Let us now try to identify the major biomes of the world. There are ﬁve major biomes — forest, desert, grassland, 125 aquatic and altitudinal biomes. Some features of these biomes are given in Table l 5. 1. Biogeochemical Cycles The sun is the basic source of energy on which all life depends. This energy initiates life processes in the biosphere through photosynthesis, the main source of food and energy for green plants. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is converted into organic compounds and oxygen. Out of the total solar insolation that reaches the earth’s surface, only a very small fraction (0.1 per cent) is fixed in photosynthesis. More than half is used for plant respiration and the remaining part is temporarily stored or is shifted to other portions of the plant. Life on earth consists of a great variety of living organisms. These living organisms exist and survive in a diversity of associations. Such survival involves the presence of systemic ﬂows such as ﬂows of energy, water and nutrients. These ﬂows show variations in different parts of the world, in different seasons of the year and under varying local circumstances. Studies have shown that for the last one billion years, the atmosphere and hydrosphere have been composed of approximately the same balance of chemical components. This balance of the chemical elements is maintained by a cyclic passage through the tissues of plants and animals. The cycle starts by absorbing the chemical elements by the organism and is returned to the air, water and soil through decomposition. These cycles are largely energised by solar insolation. These cyclic movements of chemical elements of the biosphere between the organism and the environment are referred to as biogeochemical cycles. Bio refers to living organisms and geo to rocks, soil, air and water of the earth. There are two types of biogeochemical cycles : the gaseous and the sedimentary cycle. In the gaseous cycle, the main reservoir of nutrients is the atmosphere and the ocean. In the sedimentary cycle, the main reservoir is the soil and the sedimentary and other rocks of the earth’s crust.

Anything thrown up falls down towards the earth, going uphill is lot more tiring than going downhill, raindrops from the clouds above fall towards the earth and there are many other such phenomena. Historically it was the Italian Physicist Galileo (1564- l 642) who recognised the fact that all bodies, irrespective of their masses, are accelerated towards the earth with a constant acceleration. It is said that he made a public demonstration of this fact. To find the truth, he certainly did experiments with bodies rolling down inclined planes and arrived at a value of the acceleration due to gravity which is close to the more accurate value obtained later. A seemingly unrelated phenomenon, observation of stars, planets and their motion has been the subject of attention in many countries since the earliest of times. Observations since early times recognised stars which appeared in the sky with positions unchanged year after year. The more interesting objects are the planets which seem to have regular motions against the background of stars. The earliest recorded model for planetary motions proposed by Ptolemy about 2000 years ago was a ‘geocentric’ model in which all celestial objects, stars, the sun and the planets, all revolved around the earth. The only motion that was thought to be possible for celestial objects was motion in a circle. Complicated schemes of motion were put forward by Ptolemy in order to describe the observed motion of the planets. The planets were described as moving in circles with the centre of the circles themselves moving in larger circles. Similar theories were also advanced by Indian astronomers some 400 years later. However a more elegant model in which the Sun was the centre around which the planets revolved — the ‘heliocentric’ model — was already mentioned by Aryabhatta (5th century AD.) in his treatise.

They have organ-system level of organisation. They are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic, segmented and coelomate animals. The body of arthropods is covered by chitinous exoskeleton. The body consists of head, thorax and abdomen. They have jointed appendages (arthros-joint, poda-appendages). Respiratory organs are gills, book gills, book lungs or tracheal system. Circulatory system is of open type. Sensory organs like antennae, eyes (compound and simple), statocysts or balancing organs are present. Excretion takes place through malpighian tubules. They are mostly dioecious. Fertilisation is usually internal. They are mostly oviparous. Development may be direct or indirect. Examples: Economically important insects — Apis (Honey bee), Bombyx (Silkworm), Laccifer (Lac insect) Vectors — Anopheles, Culex and Aedes (Mosquitoes) Gregarious pest — Locusta (Locust) Living fossil — Limulus (King crab). 4.2.8 Phylum — Mollusca This is the second largest animal phylum (Figure 4. 13). Molluscs are terrestrial or aquatic (marine or fresh water) having an organ-system level of organisation. They are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic and coelomate animals. Body is covered by a calcareous shell and is unsegmented with a distinct head, muscular foot and visceral hump. A soft and spongy layer of skin forms a mantle over the visceral hump. The space between the hump and the mantle is called the mantle cavity in which feather like gills are present. They have respiratory and excretory functions.

(6.32) and (6.33), we get cos ((91 + 37°) = O or 01 + 37° = 90° Thus, 91 =53° This proves the following result : when two equal masses undergo a glancing elastic collision with one of them at rest, after the collision, they will move at right angles to each other. 4 The matter simplifies greatly if we consider spherical masses with smooth surfaces, and assume that collision takes place only when the bodies touch each other. This is what happens in the games of marbles, carrom and billiards. In our everyday world, collisions take place only when two bodies touch each other. But consider a comet coming from far distances to the sun, or alpha particle coming towards a nucleus and going away in some direction. Here we have to deal with forces involving action at a distance. Such an event is called scattering. The velocities and directions in which the two particles go away depend on their initial velocities as well as the type of interaction between them, their masses, shapes and sizes. SUM'MARY i.

Then, by the definition of the average velocity, the slope of line P1P2 ( Fig. 3.6) gives the value of average velocity over the interval 3 s to 5 s. Now, we decrease the value of Atfrom 2 s to 1 s. Then line P1P2 becomes @192 and its slope gives the value of the average velocity over the interval 3.5 s to 4.5 s. In the limit At —> 0, the line P1P2 becomes tangent to the position- time curve at the point P and the velocity at t = 4 s is given by the slope of the tangent at that point. It is difficult to show this process graphically. But if we use numerical method to obtain the value of the velocity, the meaning of the limiting process becomes clear. For the graph shown in Fig. 3.6, X: 0.08 t3. Table 3.1 gives the value of Ax/At calculated for Atequal to 2.0 s, 1.0 s, 0.5 s, 0.1 s and 0.01 s centred at t= 4.0 s.

We see from Table 3.1 that as we decrease the value ofAtfrom 2.0 s to 0.010 s, the value of the average velocity approaches the limiting value 3.84 m S'1 which is the value of velocity at dx t= 4.0 s, i.e. the value of E at 1:: 4.0 s.

The living world comprises an amazing diversity of living organisms. Early man could easily perceive the difference between inanimate matter and living organisms. Early man deified some of the inanimate matter (wind, sea, fire etc.) and some among the animals and plants. A common feature of all such forms of inanimate and animate objects was the sense of awe or fear that they evoked. The description of living organisms including human beings began much later in human history. Societies which indulged in anthropocentric view of biology could register limited progress in biological knowledge. Systematic and monumental description of life forms brought in, out of necessity, detailed systems of identification, nomenclature and classification. The biggest spin off of such studies was the recognition of the sharing of similarities among living organisms both horizontally and vertically. That all present day living organisms are related to each other and also to all organisms that ever lived on this earth, was a revelation which humbled man and led to cultural movements for conservation of biodiversity. In the following chapters of this unit, you will get a description, including classification, of animals and plants from a taxonomist’s perspective. 2019-2020"

We subdivide the body into n small elements of mass; Aml, A1712..- Amn; the 1“Lh element Amiis taken to be located about the point (xi, yi, 29- The coordinates of the centre of mass are then approximately given by A . . A . . A . . X_ Z( W. ,Y_ Z( mJy. ,Z_ Z( m.)z. ZAmi ZAmi ZN“: As we make n bigger and bigger and each Ami smaller and smaller, these expressions become exact. In that case, we denote the sums over iby integrals. Thus, ZAmi —>Idm=M, Z (Ami)xi —> Ix dm, 2 (Ami)yi —> Iydm, and Z (Ami)zi —> [2 dm Here M is the total mass of the body. The coordinates of the centre of mass now are x: i M The vector expression equivalent to these three scalar expressions is J-xdm,Y= ﬁ J-ydmand ZzﬁJ-zdm (7.5a) R=ﬁjrdm (75b) If we choose, the centre of mass as the origin of our coordinate system, R=0 i.e.,Irdm=0 or dem=Iydm=Izdm=O (7.6) Often we have to calculate the centre of mass of homogeneous bodies of regular shapes like rings, discs, spheres, rods etc. (By a homogeneous body we mean a body with uniformly distributed mass.) By using symmetry consideration, we can easily show that the centres of mass of these bodies lie at their geometric centres. dm dm Fig. 7.8 Detemining the CM of a thin rod. 2019-20 Let us consider a thin rod, whose width and breath (in case the cross section of the rod is rectangular) or radius (in case the cross section of the rod is cylindrical) is much smaller than its length. Taking the origin to be at the geometric centre of the rod and x—axis to be along the length of the rod, we can say that on account of reﬂection symmetry, for every element dm of the rod at x, there is an element of the same mass dm located at —x (Fig. 7 .8). The net contribution of every such pair to the integral and hence the integral dem itself is zero. From Eq. (7.6), the point for which the integral itself is zero, is the centre of mass. Thus, the centre of mass of a homogenous thin rod coincides with its geometric centre. This can be understood on the basis of reﬂection symmetry. The same symmetry argument will apply to homogeneous rings, discs, spheres, or even thick rods of circular or rectangular cross section. For all such bodies you will realise that for every element dm at a point (x, y, 2) one can always take an element of the same mass at the point (—x, —y, —z). (In other words, the origin is a point of reﬂection symmetry for these bodies.) As a result, the integrals in Eq. (7.5 a) all are zero. This means that for all the above bodies, their centre of mass coincides with their geometric centre. p Example 7.1 Find the centre of mass of three particles at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. The masses of the particles are 100g, 150g, and 200g respectively. Each side of the equilateral triangle is 0.5m long. Answer 200 g B(o.2s,o.25/§) (025,0) A(0.5,0) Fig. 7.9"

biology/,"BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION bicuspid valves due to attempted backﬂow of blood into the atria. As the ventricular pressure increases further, the semilunar valves guarding the pulmonary artery (right side) and the aorta (left side) are forced open, allowing the blood in the ventricles to ﬂow through these vessels into the circulatory pathways. The ventricles now relax (ventricular diastole) and the ventricular pressure falls causing the closure of semilunar valves which prevents the backﬂow of blood into the ventricles. As the ventricular pressure declines further, the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are pushed open by the pressure in the atria exerted by the blood which was being emptied into them by the veins. The blood now once again moves freely to the ventricles. The ventricles and atria are now again in a relaxed (joint diastole) state, as earlier. Soon the SAN generates a new action potential and the events described above are repeated in that sequence and the process continues. This sequential event in the heart which is cyclically repeated is called the cardiac cycle and it consists of systole and diastole of both the atria and ventricles. As mentioned earlier, the heart beats 72 times per minute, i.e., that many cardiac cycles are performed per minute. From this it could be deduced that the duration of a cardiac cycle is 0.8 seconds. During a cardiac cycle, each ventricle pumps out approximately 70 mL of blood which is called the stroke volume. The stroke volume multiplied by the heart rate (no. of beats per min.) gives the cardiac output. Therefore, the cardiac output can be deﬁned as the volume of blood pumped out by each ventricle per minute and averages 5000 mL or 5 litres in a healthy individual. The body has the ability to alter the stroke volume as well as the heart rate and thereby the cardiac output. For example, the cardiac output of an athlete will be much higher than that of an ordinary man. During each cardiac cycle two prominent sounds are produced which can be easily heard through a stethoscope. The ﬁrst heart sound (lub) is associated with the closure of the tricuspid and bicuspid valves whereas the second heart sound (dub) is associated with the closure of the semilunar valves. These sounds are of clinical diagnostic signiﬁcance. 18.3.3 Electrocardiograph (ECG) You are probably familiar with this scene from a typical hospital television show: A patient is hooked up to a monitoring machine that shows voltage traces on a screen and makes the sound .. pip... pip... pip ..... peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee” as the patient goes into cardiac arrest. This type of machine (electro-cardiograph) is used to obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG). ECG is a graphical representation of the electrical activity of the heart during a cardiac cycle.

Generally, order and other higher taxonomic categories are identiﬁed based on the aggregates of characters. Order being a higher category, is the assemblage of families which exhibit a few similar characters. The similar characters are less in number as compared to different genera included in a family. Plant families like Convolvulaceae, Solanaceae are included in the order Polymoniales mainly based on the ﬂoral characters. The animal order, Carnivora, includes families like Felidae and Canidae. 1.3.5 Class This category includes related orders. For example, order Primata comprising monkey, gorilla and gibbon is placed in class Mammalia along with order Carnivora that includes animals like tiger, cat and dog. Class Mammalia has other orders also. 1 .3.6 Phylum Classes comprising animals like ﬁshes, amphibians, reptiles, birds along with mammals constitute the next higher category called Phylum. All these, based on the common features like presence of notochord and dorsal hollow neural system, are included in phylum Chordata. In case of plants, classes with a few similar characters are assigned to a higher category called Division. 1 .3.7 Kingdom All animals belonging to various phyla are assigned to the highest category called Kingdom Animalia in the classification system of animals. The Kingdom Plantae, on the other hand, is distinct, and comprises all plants from various divisions. Henceforth, we will refer to these two groups as animal and plant kingdoms. The taxonomic categories from species to kingdom have been shown in ascending order starting with species in Figure 1.1. These are broad categories. However, taxonomists have also developed sub-categories in this hierarchy to facilitate more sound and scientific placement of various taxa. Look at the hierarchy in Figure 1 . 1. Can you recall the basis of arrangement? Say, for example, as we go higher from species to kingdom, the number of common characteristics goes on 201 9-2020"

We cannot use a screw gauge or similar instruments. Even a microscope has certain limitations. An optical microscope uses visible light to ‘look’ at the system under investigation. As light has wave like features, the resolution to which an optical microscope can be used is the wavelength of light (A detailed explanation can be found in the Class XII Physics textbook). For visible light the range of wavelengths is from about 4000 A to 7000 A (1 angstrom = 1 A = 10'10 m). Hence an optical microscope cannot resolve particles with sizes smaller than this. Instead of visible light, we can use an electron beam. Electron beams can be focussed by properly designed electric and magnetic fields. The resolution of such an electron microscope is limited finally by the fact that electrons can also behave as waves ! (You will learn more about this in class XII). The wavelength of an electron can be as small as a fraction of an angstrom. Such electron microscopes with a resolution of 0.6 A have been built. They can almost resolve atoms and molecules in a material. In recent times, tunnelling microscopy has been developed in which again the limit of resolution is better than an angstrom. It is possible to estimate the sizes of molecules. A simple method for estimating the molecular size of oleic acid is given below. Oleic acid is a soapy liquid with large molecular size of the order of 10'9m. The idea is to first form mono-molecular layer of oleic acid on water surface. We dissolve 1 cm3 of oleic acid in alcohol to make a solution of 20 cm3. Then we take 1 cm3 2019-20 of this solution and dilute it to 20 cm3, using alcohol. So, the concentration of the solution is 1 20x20 solution. Next we lightly sprinkle some lycopodium powder on the surface of water in a large trough and we put one drop of this solution in the water. The oleic acid drop spreads into a thin, large and roughly circular film of molecular thickness on water surface. Then, we quickly measure the diameter of the thin film to get its area A. Suppose we have dropped n drops in the water. Initially, we determine the approximate volume of each drop (ch3). equal to ( )cm?’ of oleic acid/cm3 of Volume of n drops of solution = nV cm3 Amount of oleic acid in this solution =nV[ 1 jcm3 20x20 This solution of oleic acid spreads very fast on the surface of water and forms a very thin layer of thickness 1:. If this spreads to form a film of area A cm2, then the thickness of the film Volume of the film t : Area of the film 1: — n—ch 0“ _ 2o x20A (2'3) Ifwe assume that the ﬁlm has mono-molecular thickness, then this becomes the size or diameter of a molecule of oleic acid. The value of this thickness comes out to be of the order of 10'9 m. Example 2.5 If the size of a nucleus (in the range of 10‘15 to 10‘14 n1) is scaled up to the tip of a sharp pin. what roughly is the size of an atom ? Assume tip of the pin to be in the range lO’sm t0 10’4m. Answer The size of a nucleus is in the range of 10'15 m and 10'14 m. The tip of a sharp pin is taken to be in the range of 10'5 m and 10'4 m. Thus we are scaling up by a factor of 1010. An atom roughly of size 10'10 m will be scaled up to a size of 1 m. Thus a nucleus in an atom is as small in size as the tip of a sharp pin placed at the centre of a sphere of radius about a metre long. 4"

The pituitary hormones regulate the growth and development of somatic tissues and activities of peripheral endocrine glands. Pineal gland secretes melatonin, which plays a very important role in the regulation of 24-hour (diurnal) rhythms of our body (e. g., rhythms of sleep and state of being awake, body temperature, etc.). The thyroid gland hormones play an important role in the regulation of the basal metabolic rate, development and maturation of the central neural system, erythropoiesis, metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats, menstrual cycle. Another thyroid hormone, i.e., thyrocalcitonin regulates calcium levels in our blood by decreasing it. The parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone 07TH) which increases the blood Ca2+ levels and plays a major role in calcium homeostasis. The thymus gland secretes thymosins which play a major role in the differentiation of T-lymphocytes, which provide cell-mediated immunity. In addition, thymosins also increase the production of antibodies to provide humoral immunity. The adrenal gland 1s composed of the centrally located adrenal medulla and the outer adrenal cortex. The adrenal medulla secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones Increase alertness, pupilary dilation, p1loerectlon sweating, heart beat, strength of heart contraction, rate“, esp1ration, glypogenolys1s lipolysis, proteolysis.

Insulin deficiency and / or insulin res1stance result "" a disease called diabetes mellitus. The testis secretes androgens which stimulate the development, maturation and functions of the male accessory sex organs, appearance of the male secondary sex characters, spermatogenesis, male sexual behaviour, anabolic pathways and erythropoiesis. The ovary secretes estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen stimulates growth and development of female accessory sex organs and secondary sex characters. Progesterone plays a major role in the maintenance of pregnancy as well as in mammary gland development and lactation. The atrial wall of the heart produces atrial natriuretic factor which decreases the blood pressure. Kidney produces erythropoietin which stimulates erythropoiesis. The gastrointestinal tract secretes gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin and gastric inhibitory peptide. These hormones regulate the secretion of digestive juices and help in digestion."

As you know, during aerobic respiration, O2 is consumed and CO2 is released. The ratio of the volume of CO2 evolved to the volume of O2 consumed in respiration is called the respiratory quotient (R9) or respiratory ratio. The respiratory quotient depends upon the type of respiratory substrate used during respiration. When carbohydrates are used as substrate and are completely oxidised, the RQ will be 1, because equal amounts of CO2 and 02 are evolved and consumed, respectively, as shown in the equation below :"

physics/,"G RAVITATI ON 191 F(h) GM E h = — =— . g( ) m (RE+h)2 (8.14) This is clearly less than the value of g on the GM E surface of earth : 9 = R2 - For h << RE ,we can E expand the RHS of Eq. (8.14) : GM ,2 h For R—<< 1 , using binomial expression, E 2h 9(h)Eg[I—R—]. (8.15) E Equation (8.15) thus tells us that for small heights h above the value of g decreases by a factor (1 — 2h / RE). Now, consider a point mass m at a depth d below the surface of the earth (Fig. 8.8(b)), so that its distance from the centre of the earth is (RE — d) as shown in the figure. The earth can be thought of as being composed of a smaller sphere of radius (RE — d) and a spherical shell of thickness d. The force on m due to the outer shell of thickness d is zero because the result quoted in the previous section. As far as the smaller sphere of radius (RE — d ) is concerned, the point mass is outside it and hence according to the result quoted earlier, the force due to this smaller sphere is just as if the entire mass of the smaller sphere is concentrated at the centre. If Ms is the mass of the smaller sphere, then, Ms/ME=(RE—d)3 /RE3 (8.16) Since mass of a sphere is proportional to be cube of its radius. Earth's surface (b) Fig. 8.8 (b) g at a depth d. In this case only the smaller sphere of radius (RE—d) contributes to 9. Thus the force on the point mass is F(d) = GMsm/ (RE—d)2 (8.17) Substituting for MS from above , we get F(d) = GMEm(RE—d)/ RE3 (8.18) and hence the acceleration due to gravity at a depth d, Fd g(d)= ( )is g(d)=—F(d)=GR§E (RE-d) m RE R —d :9 :2 =g(1—d/RE) (8.19) Thus, as we go down below earth’s surface, the acceleration due gravity decreases by a factor (l—d/RE).The remarkable thing about acceleration due to earth’s gravity is that it is maximum on its surface decreasing whether you go up or down. 8.7 GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL ENERGY We had discussed earlier the notion of potential energy as being the energy stored in the body at its given position. If the position of the particle changes on account of forces acting on it, then the change in its potential energy is just the amount of work done on the body by the force. As we had discussed earlier, forces for which the work done is independent of the path are the conservative forces. The force of gravity is a conservative force and we can calculate the potential energy of a body arising out of this force, called the gravitational potential energy. Consider points close to the surface of earth, at distances from the surface much smaller than the radius of the earth. In such cases, the force of gravity is practically a constant equal to mg, directed towards the centre of the earth. If we consider a point at a height h1 from the surface of the earth and another point vertically above it at a height h,2 from the surface, the work done in lifting the particle of mass m from the first to the second position is denoted by W12 W12 = Force X displacement = mg (h, — h) (8.20) 2019-20"
physics/,"174 PHYSICS which is in contact with the surface is at rest on the surface. We have remarked earlier that rolling motion is a combination of rotation and translation. We know that the translational motion of a system of particles is the motion of its centre of mass. Fig. 7.37 The rolling motion (without slipping) of a disc on a level surface. Note at any instant, the point of contact P0 of the disc with the surface is at rest; the centre of mass of the disc moves with velocity, vcm. The disc rotates with angular velocity 6:; about its axis which passes through C; vcm =Rw, where R is the radius of the disc. Let ch be the velocity of the centre of mass and therefore the translational velocity of the disc. Since the centre of mass of the rolling disc is at its geometric centre C (Fig. 7. 37), vcm is the velocity of C. It is parallel to the level surface. The rotational motion of the disc is about its symmetry axis, which passes through C. Thus, the velocity of any point of the disc, like P0, P1 or P2, consists of two parts, one is the translational velocity ch and the other is the linear velocity vr on account of rotation. The magnitude of VT is Dr: M), where wis the angular velocity of the rotation of the disc about the axis and r is the distance of the point from the axis (i.e. from C). The velocity vr is directed perpendicular to the radius vector of the given point with respect to C. In Fig. 7 .37 , the velocity of the point P2 (v2) and its components vrand vcmare shown; vrhere is perpendicular to CP2 . It is easy to show that vZ is perpendicular to the line POPZ. Therefore the line passing through PO and parallel to a) is called the instantaneous axis of rotation. 2019-20 At Po, the linear velocity, vr, due to rotation is directed exactly opposite to the translational velocity ch- Further the magnitude of vrhere is Ra), where R is the radius of the disc. The condition that P0 is instantaneously at rest requires um = Ra). Thus for the disc the condition for rolling without slipping is vcm = R0) (7.47) Incidentally, this means that the velocity of point P1 at the top of the disc (v1) has a magnitude vcm+ Ra) or 2 v6m and is directed parallel to the level surface. The condition (7 .47) applies to all rolling bodies. 7.14. 1 Kinetic Energy of Rolling Motion Our next task will be to obtain an expression for the kinetic energy of a rolling body. The kinetic energy of a rolling body can be separated into kinetic energy of translation and kinetic energy of rotation. This is a special case of a general result for a system of particles, according to which the kinetic energy of a system of particles (K) can be separated into the kinetic energy of translational motion of the centre of mass (MW/2) and kinetic energy of rotational motion about the centre of mass of the system of particles (K’). Thus, K=K’+ MV2 /2 (7.48) We assume this general result (see Exercise 7.3 1), and apply it to the case of rolling motion. In our notation, the kinetic energy of the centre of mass, i.e., the kinetic energy of translation, of the rolling body is mvzcm / 2, where m is the mass of the body and vcm is the centre of the mass velocity. Since the motion of the rolling body about the centre of mass is rotation, K’ represents the kinetic energy of rotation of the body; K’=I(o2/2 , where I is the moment of inertia about the appropriate axis, which is the symmetry axis of the rolling body. The kinetic energy of a rolling body, therefore, is given by 1 2 1 2 K:— 10) + —m1) 2 2 cm (7.493) Substituting I = mk2 where k = the corresponding radius of gyration of the body and um: R 03, we get 1 k2 or K = 5m03m[1+—] (7.4913)"
biology/,"118 BIOLOGY On land, the buccal cavity, skin and lungs act as the respiratory organs. The respiration by lungs is called pulmonary respiration. The lungs are a pair of elongated, pink coloured sac-like structures present in the upper part of the trunk region (thorax). Air enters through the nostrils into the buccal cavity and then to lungs. During aestivation and hibernation gaseous exchange takes place through skin. The vascular system of frog is well-developed closed type. Frogs have a lymphatic system also. The blood vascular system involves heart, blood vessels and blood. The lymphatic system consists of lymph, lymph channels and lymph nodes. Heart is a muscular structure situated in the upper part of the body cavity. It has three chambers, two atria and one ventricle and is covered by a membrane called pericardium. A triangular structure called sinus venosus joins the right atrium. It receives blood through the major veins called vena cava. The ventricle opens into a sac- like conus arteriosus on the ventral side of the heart. The blood from the heart is carried to all parts of the body by the arteries (arterial system). The veins collect blood from different parts of body to the heart and form the venous system. Special venous connection between liver and intestine as well as the kidney and lower parts of the body are present in frogs. The former is called hepatic portal system and the latter is called renal portal system. The blood is composed of plasma and cells. The blood cells are RBC (red blood cells) or erythrocytes, WBC (white blood cells) or leucocytes and platelets. RBC’s are nucleated and contain red coloured pigment namely haemoglobin. The lymph is different from blood. It lacks few proteins and RBCs. The blood carries nutrients, gases and water to the respective sites during the circulation. The circulation of blood is achieved by the pumping action of the muscular heart. The elimination of nitrogenous wastes is carried out by a well developed excretory system. The excretory system consists of a pair of kidneys, ureters, cloaca and urinary bladder. These are compact, dark red and bean like structures situated a little posteriorly in the body cavity on both sides of vertebral column. Each kidney is composed of several structural and functional units called uriniferous tubules or nephrons. Two ureters emerge from the kidneys in the male frogs. The ureters act as urinogenital duct which opens into the cloaca. In females the ureters and oviduct open seperately in the cloaca. The thin-walled urinary bladder is present ventral to the rectum which also opens in the cloaca. The frog excretes urea and thus is a ureotelic animal. Excretory wastes are carried by blood into the kidney where it is separated and excreted. The system for control and coordination is highly evolved in the frog. It includes both neural system and endocrine glands. The chemical coordination of various organs of the body is achieved by hormones which are secreted by the endocrine glands. The prominent endocrine glands found in frog are pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, pineal body, pancreatic islets, adrenals and gonads. The nervous system is organised"
geography/,"92 Thunderstorms and Tornadoes Other severe local storms are thunderstorms and tornadoes. They are of short duration, occurring over a small area but are violent. Thunderstorms are caused by intense convection on moist hot days. A thunderstorm is a well-grown cumulonimbus cloud producing thunder and lightening. When the clouds extend to heights where sub-zero temperature prevails, hails are formed and they come down as hailstorm. If there is insufﬁcient moisture, a thunderstorm can generate dust- storms. A thunderstorm is characterised by intense updraft of rising warm air, which causes the clouds to grow bigger and rise to FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY greater height. This causes precipitation. Later, downdraft brings down to earth the cool air and the rain. From severe thunderstorms sometimes spiralling wind descends like a trunk of an elephant with great force, with very low pressure at the centre, causing massive destruction on its way. Such a phenomenon is called a tornado. Tornadoes generally occur in middle latitudes. The tornado over the sea is called water spouts. These violent storms are the manifestation of the atmosphere’s adjustments to varying energy distribution. The potential and heat energies are converted into kinetic energy in these storms and the restless atmosphere again returns to its stable state. m, EXERCISES 7 1. Multiple choice questions.

biology/,"96 BIOLOGY 6.4.1.3 Spring wood and autumn wood The activity of cambium is under the control of many physiological and environmental factors. In temperate regions, the climatic conditions are not uniform through the year. In the spring season, cambium is very active and produces a large number of xylary elements having vessels with wider cavities. The wood formed during this season is called spring wood or early wood. In winter, the cambium is less active and forms fewer xylary elements that have narrow vessels, and this wood is called autumn wood or late wood. The spring wood is lighter in colour and has a lower density whereas the autumn wood is darker and has a higher density. The two kinds of woods that appear as alternate concentric rings, constitute an annual ring. Annual rings seen in a cut stem give an estimate of the age of the tree. 6.4.1.4 Heartwood and sapwood In old trees, the greater part of secondary xylem is dark brown due to deposition of organic compounds like tannins, resins, oils, gums, aromatic substances and essential oils in the central or innermost layers of the stem. These substances make it hard, durable and resistant to the attacks of micro- organisms and insects. This region comprises dead elements with highly ligniﬁed walls and is called heartwood. The heartwood does not conduct water but it gives mechanical support to the stem. The peripheral region of the secondary xylem, is lighter in colour and is known as the sapwood. It is involved in the conduction of water and minerals from root to leaf. 6.4.2 Cork Cambium As the stem continues to increase in girth due to the activity of vascular cambium, the outer cortical and epidermis layers get broken and need to be replaced to provide new protective cell layers. Hence, sooner or later, another meristematic tissue called cork cambium or phellogen develops, usually in the cortex region. Phellogen is a couple of layers thick. It is made of narrow, thin-walled and nearly rectangular cells. Phellogen cuts off cells on both sides. The outer cells differentiate into cork or phellem while the inner cells differentiate into secondary cortex or phelloderm. The cork is impervious to water due to suberin deposition in the cell wall. The cells of secondary cortex are parenchymatous. Phellogen, phellem, and phelloderm are collectively known as periderm. Due to activity of the cork cambium, pressure builds up on the remaining layers peripheral"

The pressure that is produced by the swelling of wood had been used by prehistoric man to split rocks and boulders. If it were not for the pressure due to imbibition, seedlings would not have been able to emerge out of the soil into the open; they probably would not have been able to establish! Imbibition is also diffusion since water movement is along a concentration gradient; the seeds and other such materials have almost no water hence they absorb water easily. Water potential gradient between the absorbent and the liquid imbibed is essential for imbibition. In addition, for any substance to imbibe any liquid, afﬁnity between the adsorbant and the liquid is also a pre-requisite. 1 1.3 LONG DISTANCE TRANSPORT OF WATER At some earlier stage you might have carried out an experiment where you had placed a twig bearing white ﬂowers in coloured water and had watched it turn colour. On examining the cut end of the twig after a few hours you had noted the region through which the coloured water moved. ’Ihat experiment very easily demonstrates that the path of water movement is through the vascular bundles, more speciﬁcally, the xylem. Now we have to go further and try and understand the mechanism of movement of water and other substances up a plant. Long distance transport of substances within a plant cannot be by diffusion alone. Diffusion is a slow process. It can account for only short distance movement of molecules. For example, the movement of a molecule across a typical plant cell (about 50 um) takes approximately 2.5 s. At this rate, can you calculate how many years it would take for the movement of molecules over a distance of 1 m within a plant by diffusion alone? In large and complex organisms, often substances have to be moved to long distances. Sometimes the sites of production or absorption and sites of storage are too far from each other; diffusion or active transport would not sufﬁce. Special long distance transport systems become necessary so as to move substances across long distances and at a much faster rate. Water and minerals, and food are generally moved by a mass or bulk ﬂow system. Mass ﬂow is the movement of substances in bulk or en masse from one point to another as a result of pressure differences between the two points. It is a characteristic of mass ﬂow that substances, whether in solution or in suspension, are swept along at the same pace, as in a ﬂowing river. This is unlike diffusion where different substances move independently depending on their concentration gradients. Bulk ﬂow can be achieved either through a positive hydrostatic pressure gradient (e. g., a garden hose) or a negative hydrostatic pressure gradient (e. g., suction through a straw). 183"

biology/,"72 Figure 5.12 Cymose inﬂorescence BIOLOGY ﬂoral axis is termed as inﬂorescence. Depending on whether the apex gets developed into a ﬂower or continues to grow, two major types of inﬂorescences are deﬁned — racemose and cymose. In racemose type of inﬂorescences the main axis continues to grow, the ﬂowers are borne laterally in an acropetal succession (Figure 5.1 1). In cymose type of inﬂorescence the main axis terminates in a ﬂower, hence is limited in growth.The ﬂowers are borne in a basipetal order (Figure 5.12). 5.5 THE FLOWER The ﬂower is the reproductive unit in the angiosperms. It is meant for sexual reproduction. A typical ﬂower has four different kinds of whorls arranged successively on the swollen end of the stalk or pedicel, called thalamus or receptacle. These are calyx, corolla, androecium and gynoecium. Calyx and corolla are accessory organs, while androecium and gynoecium are reproductive organs. In some ﬂowers like lily, the calyx and corolla are not distinct and are termed as perianth. When a ﬂower has both androecium and gynoecium, it is bisexual. A ﬂower having either only stamens or only carpels is unisexual. In symmetry, the ﬂower may be actinomorphic (radial symmetry) or zygomorphic (bilateral symmetry). When a ﬂower can be divided into two equal radial halves in any radial plane passing through the centre, it is said to be actinomorphic, e. g., mustard, datura, chilli. When it can be divided into two similar halves only in one particular vertical plane, it is zygomorphic, e.g., pea, gulmohur, bean, Cassia. A ﬂower is asymmetric (irregular) if it cannot be divided into two similar halves by any vertical plane passing through the centre, as in canna. A ﬂower may be trimerous, tetramerous or pentamerous when the ﬂoral appendages are in multiple of 3, 4 or 5, respectively. Flowers with bracts-reduced leaf found at the base of the pedicel-are called bracteate and those without bracts, ebracteate."
physics/,"MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS N (fl OJ Fig. 1 0.3 Fluid under gravity. The effect of gravity is illustrated through pressure on a vertical cylindrical column. Pressure difference depends on the vertical distance h between the points (1 and 2), mass density of the ﬂuid p and acceleration due to gravity 9. If the point 1 under discussion is shifted to the top of the ﬂuid (say, water), which is open to the atmosphere, P1 may be replaced by atmospheric pressure (Pa) and we replace P2 by P. Then Eq. (10.6) gives P=Pa+pgh (10.7) Thus, the pressure P, at depth below the surface of a liquid open to the atmosphere is greater than atmospheric pressure by an amount pgh. The excess of pressure, P —Pa, at depth h is called a gauge pressure at that point. The area of the cylinder is not appearing in the expression of absolute pressure in Eq. (10.7 ). Thus, the height of the ﬂuid column is important and not cross-sectional or base area or the shape of the container. The liquid pressure is the same at all points at the same horizontal level (same depth). The result is appreciated through the example of hydrostatic paradox. Consider three vessels A, B and C [Fig.10.4] of different shapes. They are connected at the bottom by a horizontal pipe. On filling with water, the level in the three vessels is the same, though they hold different amounts of water. This is so because water at the bottom has the same pressure below each section of the vessel. Fig 10.4 Illustration of hydrostatic paradox. The three vessels A, B and C contain different amounts of liquids, all upto the same height. Example 10.2 What is the pressure on a swimmer 10 m below the surface ofa lake? Answer Here h = 10 m andp = 1000 kg m'3. Take g = 10 m s-2 From Eq. (10.7) P = Pa + p gh = 1.01 x 105 Pa+ 1000kgm*3 x 10 ms—2 >< 10m = 2.01 x 105 Pa z 2 atm This is a 100% increase in pressure from surface level. At a depth of 1 km, the increase in pressure is 100 atm! Submarines are designed to withstand such enormous pressures. 4 10.2.3 Atmospheric Pressure and Gauge Pressure The pressure of the atmosphere at any point is equal to the weight of a column of air of unit cross-sectional area extending from that point to the top of the atmosphere. At sea level, it is 1.0 13 x 105 Pa (1 atm). Italian scientist Evangelista Torricelli (1608—1647) devised for the first time a method for measuring atmospheric pressure. A long glass tube closed at one end and filled with mercury is inverted into a trough of mercury as shown in Fig. 10.5 (a). This device is known as ‘mercury barometer’. The space above the mercury column in the tube contains only mercury vapour whose pressure P is so small that it may be neglected. Thus, the pressure at Point A=0. The pressure inside the coloumn at Point B must be the same as the pressure at Point C, which is atmospheric pressure, Pa. Pa = p gh (10.8) where p is the density of mercury and h is the height of the mercury column in the tube. 2019-20"
biology/,"218 BIOLOGY Hence for every CO2 molecule entering the Calvin cycle, 3 molecules of ATP and 2 of NADPH are required. It is probably to meet this difference in number of ATP and NADPH used in the dark reaction that the cyclic phosphorylation takes place. To make one molecule of glucose 6 turns of the cycle are required. Work out how many ATP and NADPH molecules will be required to make one molecule of glucose through the Calvin pathway. It might help you to understand all of this if we look at what goes in and what comes out of the Calvin cycle. 13.8 THE C4 PATHWAY Plants that are adapted to dry tropical regions have the C 4 pathway mentioned earlier. Though these plants have the C 4 oxaloacetic acid as the ﬁrst CO2 ﬁxation product they use the C3 pathway or the Calvin cycle as the main biosynthetic pathway. Then, in what way are they different from C3 plants? This is a question that you may reasonably ask. C 4 plants are special: They have a special type of leaf anatomy, they tolerate higher temperatures, they show a response to high light intensities, they lack a process called photorespiration and have greater productivity of biomass. Let us understand these one by one. Study vertical sections of leaves, one of a C3 plant and the other of a C 4 plant. Do you notice the differences? Do both have the same types of mesophylls? Do they have similar cells around the vascular bundle sheath? The particularly large cells around the vascular bundles of the C 4 plants are called bundle sheath cells, and the leaves which have such anatomy are said to have ‘Kranz’ anatomy. ‘Kranz’ means ‘wreath’ and is a reﬂection of the arrangement of cells. The bundle sheath cells may form several layers around the vascular bundles; they are characterised by having a large number of chloroplasts, thick walls impervious to gaseous exchange and no intercellular spaces. You may like to cut a section of the leaves of C 4 plants — maize or sorghum — to observe the Kranz anatomy and the distribution of mesophyll cells. It would be interesting for you to collect leaves of diverse species of plants around you and cut vertical sections of the leaves. Observe under the microscope — look for the bundle sheath around the vascular bundles. The presence of the bundle sheath would help you identify the C 4 plants."
physics/,"G RAVITATI ON I 9 7 — India's Leap into Space India started its space programme in 1962 when Indian National Committee for Space Research was set up by the Government of India which was superseded by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969. ISRO identiﬁed the role and importance of space technology in nation‘s development and bringing space to the service of the common man. India launched its ﬁrst low orbit satellite Aryabhata in 1975, for which the launch vehicle was provided by the erstwhile Soviet Union. ISRO started employing its indigenous launching vehicle in 1979 by sending Rohini series of satellites into space from its main launch site at Satish Dhawan Space Center. Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The tremendous progress in India’s space programme has made ISRO one of the six largest space agencies in the world. ISRO develops and delivers application specific satellite products and tools for broadcasts. communication. weather forecasts, disaster management tools. Geographic Information System. cartography. navigation. telemedicine, dedicated distance education satellite etc. In order to achieve complete self—reliance in these applications, cost effective and reliable Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle [PSLV) was developed in early 19905. PSLV has thus become a favoured carrier for satellites of various countries, promoting unprecedented international collaboration. In 2001, the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle [GSLVj was developed for launching heavier and more demanding Geosynchronous communication satellites. Various research centers and autonomous institutions for remote sensing. astronomy and astrophysics, atmospheric sciences and space research are functioning under the aegis of the Department of Space. Government of India. Success of lunar [Chandrayaan] and inter planetary (Mangalyaan) missions along with other scientiﬁc projects has been landmark achievements of ISRO. Future endeavors of ISRO in— clude human space ﬂight projects, the development of heavy lift launchers. reusable launch vehicles, semi—cryogenic engines, single and two stage to orbit ($810 and TSTO) vehicles. development and use of composite materials for space application etc. In 1984 Rakesh Sharma became the ﬁrst Indian to go into outer space aboard in a USSR spaceship. [www.isro.gov.in) Thus radio waves broadcast from an antenna at close distances with good resolution. can be received at points far away where the Information gathered from such satellites direct wave fail to reach on account of the is extremely useful for remote sensing, curvature of the earth. Waves used in television broadcast or other forms of communication have much higher frequencies and thus cannot be received beyond the line of sight. A Geostationery satellite, appearing ﬁxed above the broadcasting station can however receive these signals and broadcast them back to a wide area on earth. The INSAT group of satellites sent up by India are one such group of Geostationary satellites widely used for telecommunications in India. Another class of satellites are called the Polar satellites (Fig. 8.1 1). These are low altitude (h z 500 to 800 km) satellites, but they go around the poles of the earth in a north-south direction whereas the earth rotates around its axis in an east-west direction. Since its time period is around 100 minutes it crosses any altitude many times a day. However, since its height h above the earth is about 500-800 km, a camera fixed on it can view only small strips of the earth in one orbit. Adjacent strips are viewed in the next orbit, so that in effect the whole earth can be viewed strip by strip during the entire day. These satellites can view polar and equatorial regions meterology as well as for environmental studies of the earth. 8. 12 WEIGHTLESSNESS Weight of an object is the force with which the earth attracts it. We are conscious of our own weight when we stand on a surface, since the surface exerts a force opposite to our weight to keep us at rest. The same principle holds good when we measure the weight of an object by a spring balance hung from a fixed point e. g. the ceiling. The object would fall down unless it is subject to a force opposite to gravity. This is exactly what the spring exerts on the object. This is because the spring is pulled down a little by the gravitational pull of the object and in turn the spring exerts a force on the object vertically upwards. Now, imagine that the top end of the balance is no longer held fixed to the top ceiling of the room. Both ends of the spring as well as the object move with identical acceleration g. The spring is not stretched and does not exert any upward force on the obj ect which is moving down with acceleration 9 due to gravity. The reading 2019-20"

Erythrocytes or red blood cells (RBC) are the most abundant of all the cells in blood. A healthy adult man has, on an average, 5 millions to 5.5 millions of RBCs mm‘3 of blood. RBCs are formed in the red bone marrow in the adults. RBCs are devoid of nucleus in most of the mammals and are biconcave in shape. They have a red coloured, iron containing complex protein called haemoglobin, hence the colour and name of these cells. A healthy individual has 12- 16 gms of haemoglobin in every 100 ml of blood. These molecules play a signiﬁcant role in transport of respiratory gases. RBCs have an average life span of 120 days after which they are destroyed in the spleen (graveyard of RBCs). Leucocytes are also known as white blood cells (WBC) as they are colourless due to the lack of haemoglobin. They are nucleated and are relatively lesser in number which averages 6000-8000 mm‘3 of blood. Leucocytes are generally short lived. We have two main categories of WBCs — granulocytes and agranulocytes. Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils are different types of granulocytes, while lymphocytes and monocytes are the agranulocytes. Neutrophils are the most abundant cells (60-65 per cent) of the total WBCs and basophils are the least (0.5- 1 per cent) among them. Neutrophils and monocytes (6-8 per cent) are phagocytic cells which destroy foreign organisms entering the body.

In the hypogynous ﬂower the gynoecium occupies the highest position while the other parts are situated below it. The ovary in such ﬂowers is said to be superior, e. g., mustard, china rose and brinj a1. If gynoecium is situated in the centre and other parts of the ﬂower are located on the rim of the thalamus almost at the same level, it is called perigynous. The ovary here is said to be half inferior, e.g., plum, rose, peach. In epigynous ﬂowers, the margin of thalamus grows upward enclosing the ovary completely and getting fused with it, the other parts of ﬂower arise above the ovary.

The v-t curve is a straight line parallel to the time axis and the area under it between t = O and t= T is the area of the rectangle of height u and base T. Therefore, area = uXT = uT which is the displacement in this time interval. How come in this case an area is equal to a distance? Think! Note the dimensions of quantities on the two coordinate axes, and you will arrive at the answer. Note that the x-t, v-t, and a-t graphs shown in several ﬁgures in this chapter have sharp kinks at some points implying that the functions are not differentiable at these points. In any realistic situation, the functions will be differentiable at all points and the graphs will be smooth. What this means physically is that acceleration and velocity cannot change values abruptly at an instant. Changes are always continuous. 3.6 KINEMATIC EQUATIONS FOR UNIFORMLY ACCELERATED MOTION For uniformly accelerated motion, we can derive some simple equations that relate displacement (x), time taken (t), initial velocity (v0), final velocity (v) and acceleration (a). Equation (3.6) already obtained gives a relation between final and initial velocities v and v0 of an object moving with uniform acceleration a : v = v0 + at (3.6) This relation is graphically represented in Fig. 3. 12.

The electrical potential difference across the resting plasma membrane is called as the resting potential. You might be curious to know about the mechanisms of generation of nerve impulse and its conduction along an axon. When a stimulus is applied at a site (Figure 21.2 e. g., point A) on the polarised membrane, the membrane at the site A becomes freely permeable to Na’“. This leads to a rapid inﬂux of Na+ followed by the reversal of the polarity at that site, i.e., the outer surface of the membrane becomes negatively charged and the inner side becomes positively charged. The polarity of the membrane at the site A is thus reversed and hence depolarised. The electrical potential difference across the plasma membrane at the site A is called the action potential, which is in fact termed as a nerve impulse. At sites immediately ahead, the axon (e. g., site B) membrane has a positive charge on the outer surface and a negative charge on its inner surface. As a result, a current ﬂows on the inner surface from site A to site B. On the outer surface current ﬂows from site B to site A (Figure 2 1.2) to complete the circuit of current ﬂow. Hence, the polarity at the site is reversed, and an action potential is generated at site B. Thus, the impulse (action potential) generated at site A arrives at site B. The sequence is repeated along the length of the axon and consequently the impulse is conducted. The rise in the stimulus-induced permeability to Na+ is extremely short- lived. It is quickly followed by a rise in permeability to K’“. Within a fraction of a second, K’“ diffuses outside the membrane and restores the resting potential of the membrane at the site of excitation and the ﬁbre becomes once more responsive to further stimulation."

Divide the interval on x—axis from a to b into a large number (N) of small intervals: x0(=a) to x1, x1 to x2 ; x2 to x3, ................................ xNJ to xN (=b).

The mouth opens into a short tubular pharynx, leading to a narrow tubular passage called oesophagus. This in turn opens into a sac like structure called crop used for storing of food. The crop is followed by gizzard or proventriculus. It has an outer layer of thick circular muscles and thick inner cuticle forming six highly chitinous plate called teeth. Gizzard helps in grinding the food particles. The entire foregut is lined by cuticle. A ring of 6-8 blind tubules called hepatic or gastric caeca is present at the junction of foregut and midgut, which secrete digestive juice. At the junction of midgut and hindgut is present another ring of 100-150 yellow coloured thin ﬁlamentous Malpighian tubules. They help in removal of excretory products from haemolymph. The hindgut is broader than midgut and is differentiated into ileum, colon and rectum. The rectum opens out through anus. Blood vascular system of cockroach is an open type (Figure 7.17). Blood vessels are poorly developed and open into space (haemocoel). Visceral organs located in the haemocoel are bathed in blood (haemolymph). The haemolymph is composed of colourless plasma and haemocytes. Heart of cockroach consists of elongated muscular tube lying along mid dorsal line of thorax and abdomen. It is differentiated into funnel shaped chambers with ostia on either side. Blood from sinuses enter heart through ostia and is pumped anteriorly to sinuses again.

biology/,"CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION Prophase I Metaphase 1 Anaphase 1 Figure 10.3 Stages of Meiosis I Anaphase I: The homologous chromosomes separate, while sister chromatids remain associated at their centromeres (Figure 10.3). Telophase I: The nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear, cytokinesis follows and this is called as dyad of cells (Figure 10.3). Although in many cases the chromosomes do undergo some dispersion, they do not reach the extremely extended state of the interphase nucleus. The stage between the two meiotic divisions is called interkinesis and is generally short lived. There is no replication of DNA during interkinesis. Interkinesis is followed by prophase II, a much simpler prophase than prophase 1. 10.4.2 Meiosis II Prophase II: Meiosis II is initiated immediately after cytokinesis, usually before the chromosomes have fully elongated. In contrast to meiosis I, meiosis II resembles a normal mitosis. The nuclear membrane disappears by the end of prophase 11 (Figure 10.4). The chromosomes again become compact. Metaphase II: At this stage the chromosomes align at the equator and the microtubules from opposite poles of the spindle get attached to the kinetochores (Figure 10.4) of sister chromatids. Anaphase II: It begins with the simultaneous splitting of the centromere of each chromosome (which was holding the sister chromatids together), allowing them to move toward opposite poles of the cell (Figure 10.4) by shortening of microtubules attached to kinetochores.

Estrogens also regulate female sexual behaviour. Progesterone supports pregnancy. Progesterone also acts on the mammary glands and stimulates the formation of alveoli (sac-like structures which store milk) and milk secretion. 22.3 HORMONES 0F HEART, KIDNEY AND GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT Now you know about the endocrine glands and their hormones. However, as mentioned earlier, hormones are also secreted by some tissues which are not endocrine glands. For example, the atrial wall of our heart secretes a very important peptide hormone called atrial natriuretic factor (AN F), which decreases blood pressure. When blood pressure is increased, ANF is secreted which causes dilation of the blood vessels. This reduces the blood pressure. The j uxtaglomerular cells of kidney produce a peptide hormone called erythropoietin which stimulates erythropoiesis (formation of RBC). Endocrine cells present in different parts of the gastro-intestinal tract secrete four major peptide hormones, namely gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). Gastrin acts on the gastric glands and stimulates the secretion of hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen. Secretin acts on the exocrine pancreas and stimulates secretion of water and bicarbonate ions. CCK acts on both pancreas and gall bladder and stimulates the secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile juice, respectively. GIP inhibits gastric secretion and motility. Several other non-endocrine tissues secrete hormones called growth factors. These factors are essential for the normal growth of tissues and their repairing/ regeneration. 22.4 MECHANISM OF HORMONE ACTION Hormones produce their effects on target tissues by binding to specific proteins called hormone receptors located in the target tissues only. Hormone receptors present on the cell membrane of the target cells are called membrane-bound receptors and the receptors present inside the target cell are called intracellular receptors, mostly nuclear receptors (present in the nucleus). Binding of a hormone to its receptor leads to the formation of a hormone-receptor complex (Figure 22.5 a, b). Each receptor is speciﬁc to one hormone only and hence receptors are speciﬁc. Hormone-Receptor complex formation leads to certain biochemical changes in the target tissue. Target tissue metabolism and hence 339"

As over a million species of animals have been described till now, the need for classiﬁcation becomes all the more important. The classification also helps in assigning a systematic position to newly described species. 4. l BASIS OF CLASSIFICATION Inspite of differences in structure and form of different animals, there are fundamental features common to various individuals in relation to the arrangement of cells, body symmetry, nature of coelom, patterns of digestive, circulatory or reproductive systems. These features are used as the basis of animal classification and some of them are discussed here. 4. 1. 1 Levels of Organisation Though all members of Animalia are multicellular, all of them do not exhibit the same pattern of organisation of cells. For example, in sponges, the cells are arranged as loose cell aggregates, i.e., they exhibit cellular level of organisation. Some division of labour (activities) occur among the cells. In coelenterates, the arrangement of cells is more complex. Here the cells performing the same function are arranged into tissues, hence is called tissue level of organisation. A still higher level of organisation, i.e., organ level is exhibited by members of Platyhelminthes and other higher phyla Where tissues are grouped together to form organs, each specialised for a particular function.

Weight supported by each thighbone of the performer = 1/2 (2156) N = 1078 N. From Table 9.1, the Young’s modulus for bone is given by Y = 9.4 x 109 N m‘z. Length of each thighbone L = 0.5 m the radius of thighbone = 2.0 cm Thus the cross-sectional area of the thighbone A = 7: x (2 x 102)2 m2 = 1.26 x 10'3 m2. Using Eq.

It consists of two long straight wires of same length and equal radius suspended side by side from a fixed rigid support. The wire A (called the reference wire) carries a millimetre main scale M and a pan to place a weight. The wire B (called the experimental wire) of uniform area of cross- section also carries a pan in which known weights can be placed. A vernier scale V is attached to a pointer at the bottom of the experimental wire B, and the main scale M is fixed to the reference wire A. The weights placed in the pan exert a downward force and stretch the experimental wire under a tensile stress. The elongation of the wire (increase in length) is measured by the vernier arrangement. The reference wire is used to compensate for any change in length that may occur due to change in room temperature, since any change in length of the reference wire due to temperature change will be accompanied by an equal change in experimental wire. (We shall study these temperature effects in detail in Chapter 1 1.)

Both the reference and experimental wires are given an initial small load to keep the wires straight and the vernier reading is noted. Now the experimental wire is gradually loaded with more weights to bring it under a tensile stress and the vernier reading is noted again. The difference between two vernier readings gives the elongation produced in the wire. Let r and L be the initial radius and length of the experimental wire, respectively. Then the area of cross-section of the wire would be n12. Let M be the mass that produced an elongation AL in the wire.

biology/,"228 BIOLOGY distance that gases must diffuse even in large, bulky plants is not great. Each living cell in a plant is located quite close to the surface of the plant. This is true for leaves’, you may ask, ‘but what about thick, woody stems and roots?’ In stems, the ‘living’ cells are organised in thin layers inside and beneath the bark. They also have openings called lenticels. The cells in the interior are dead and provide only mechanical support. Thus, most cells of a plant have at least a part of their surface in contact with air. This is also facilitated by the loose packing of parenchyma cells in leaves, stems and roots, which provide an interconnected network of air spaces. The complete combustion of glucose, which produces CO2 and H20 as end products, yields energy most of which is given out as heat. Gngg +. 1632: _—:‘>i meg lilaﬂér+JEnef ‘ If this energy is to be useful to the cell, it should be able to utilise it to synthesise other molecules that the cell requires. The strategy that the plant cell uses is to catabolise the glucose molecule in such a way that not all the liberated energy goes out as heat. The key is to oxidise glucose not in one step but in several small steps enabling some steps to be just large enough such that the energy released can be coupled to ATP synthesis. How this is done is, essentially, the story of respiration. During the process of respiration, oxygen is utilised, and carbon dioxide, water and energy are released as products. The combustion reaction requires oxygen. But some cells live where oxygen may or may not be available. Can you think of such situations (and organisms) where 02 is not available? There are sufﬁcient reasons to believe that the ﬁrst cells on this planet lived in an atmosphere that lacked oxygen. Even among present-day living organisms, we know of several that are adapted to anaerobic conditions. Some of these organisms are facultative anaerobes, while in others the requirement for anaerobic condition is obligate. In any case, all living organisms retain the enzymatic machinery to partially oxidise glucose without the help of oxygen. This breakdown of glucose to pyruvic acid is called glycolysis. 14.2 GLYCOLYSIS The term glycolysis has originated from the Greek words, glycos for sugar, and lysis for splitting. The scheme of glycolysis was given by Gustav Embden, Otto Meyerhof, and J. Parnas, and is often referred to as the EMP pathway. In anaerobic organisms, it is the only process in respiration. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and is present in all living organisms. In this process, glucose undergoes partial oxidation to form two molecules of pyruvic acid. In plants, this glucose is derived from sucrose, which is the end product of photosynthesis, or from storage"

Figure 7 .24 illustrates a similar experiment that you can easily perform. Take an irregular- shaped cardboard having mass M and a narrow tipped object like a pencil. You can locate by trial and error a point G on the cardboard where it can be balanced on the tip of the pencil. (The cardboard remains horizontal in this position.) This point of balance is the centre of gravity (CG) of the cardboard. The tip of the pencil provides a vertically upward force due to which the cardboard is in mechanical equilibrium. As shown in the Fig. 7 .24, the reaction of the tip is equal and opposite to Mg and hence the cardboard is in translational equilibrium. It is also in rotational equilibrium; if it were not so, due to the unbalanced torque it would tilt and fall. There are torques on the card board due to the forces of gravity like mlg, ng etc, acting on the individual particles that make up the cardboard. Fig. 7.24 Balancing a cardboard on the tip of a pencil. The point of support, G, is the centre of gravity. The CG of the cardboard is so located that the total torque on it due to the forces mg, mg . etc. is zero. If ri is the position vector of the ith particle of an extended body with respect to its CG, then the torque about the CG, due to the force of gravity on the particle is It: riX mg. The total gravitational torque about the CG is zero, i.e. tg=Zti=Zrixmig=0 (7.33) We may therefore, define the CG of a body as that point where the total gravitational torque on the body is zero. We notice that in Eq. (7 .33), g is the same for all particles, and hence it comes out of the summation. This gives, since g is non-zero, Z mirl. = 0. Remember that the position vectors (1"",) are taken with respect to the CG. Now, in accordance with the reasoning given below Eq. (7.4a) in Sec. 7 .2, if the sum is zero, the origin must be the centre of mass of the body. Thus, the centre of gravity of the body coincides with the centre of mass in uniform gravity or gravity- free space. We note that this is true because the body being small, g does not Fig. 7.25 Determining the centre of gravity of a body of irregular shape.

Qualitatively, we can again understand this result. Various regions of the spherical shell attract the point mass inside it in various directions. These forces cancel each other completely. 8.4 THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT The value of the gravitational constant G entering the Universal law of gravitation can be determined experimentally and this was first done by English scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798. The apparatus used by him is schematically shown in figure.8.6 Fig. 8.6 Schematic drawing of Cavendish’s experiment. SI and 82 are large spheres which are kept on either side (shown shades) of the masses at A and B. When the big spheres are taken to the other side of the masses (shown by dotted circles), the bar AB rotates a little since the torque reverses direction. The angle of rotation can be measured experimentally. The bar AB has two small lead spheres attached at its ends. The bar is suspended from a rigid support by a fine wire. Two large lead spheres are brought close to the small ones but on opposite sides as shown. The big spheres attract the nearby small ones by equal and opposite force as shown. There is no net force on the bar but only a torque which is clearly equal to F times the length of the bar,where F is the force of attraction between a big sphere and its neighbouring small sphere. Due to this torque, the suspended wire gets twisted till such time as the restoring torque of the wire equals the gravitational torque . If 9 is the angle of twist of the suspended wire, the restoring torque is proportional to 9, equal to 10. Where 1' is the restoring couple per unit angle of twist. 1 can be measured independently e.g. by applying a known torque and measuring the angle of twist. The gravitational force between the spherical balls is the same as if their masses are concentrated at their centres. Thus if d is the separation between the centres of the big and its neighbouring small ball, M and In their masses, the gravitational force between the big sphere and its neighouring small ball is. Mm d2 (8'6) If L is the length of the bar AB , then the torque arising out of F is F multiplied by L. At equilibrium, this is equal to the restoring torque and hence Mm 2 F=G G L=r 6 (8.7) Observation of 9 thus enables one to calculate G from this equation. Since Cavendish’s experiment, the measurement of G has been refined and the currently accepted value is G = 6.67><10‘11 N mZ/kg2 (8.8) 8.5 ACCELERATION DUE TO GRAVITY OF THE EARTH The earth can be imagined to be a sphere made of a large number of concentric spherical shells with the smallest one at the centre and the largest one at its surface. A point outside the earth is obviously outside all the shells. Thus, all the shells exert a gravitational force at the point outside just as if their masses are concentrated at their common centre according to the result stated in section 8.3. The total mass of all the shells combined is just the mass of the earth. Hence, at a point outside the earth, the gravitational force is just as if its entire mass of the earth is concentrated at its centre. For a point inside the earth, the situation is different. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.7 . 2019-20"

The cambium is generally more active on the inner side than on the outer. As a result, the amount of secondary xylem produced is more than secondary phloem and soon forms a compact mass. The primary and secondary phloems get gradually crushed due to the continued formation and accumulation of secondary xylem. The primary xylem however remains more or less intact, in or around the centre. At some places, the cambium forms a narrow band of parenchyma, which passes through the secondary xylem and the secondary phloem in the radial directions. These are the secondary medullary rays (Figure 6.9).

biology/,"CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION 333 22.2.2 The Pituitary Gland Hypothalamus Hypothalamic The pituitary gland is located in a bony cavity ‘ neurons called sella tursica and is attached to hypothalamus by a stalk (Figure 22.2). It is divided anatomically into an adenohypophysis and a neurohypophysis. Adenohypophysis consists of two portions, pars distalis and pars intermedia. The pars distalis region of pituitary, commonly called anterior pituitary, produces growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle Portal circulation stimulating hormone (FSH). Pars intermedia Posterior secretes only one hormone called melanocyte 'i 7 pimitary stimulating hormone (MSH). However, in humans, the pars intermedia is almost merged Anterior with pars distalis. Neurohypophysis (pars pituitary nervosa) also known as posterior pituitary, stores Figure 22.2 Diagrammatic representation of and releases two hormones called oxytocin and pituitary and its rekﬁ‘ﬁOUShiP With hypothalamus vasopressin, which are actually synthesised by the hypothalamus and are transported axonally to neurohypophysis. Over-secretion of GH stimulates abnormal growth of the body leading to gigantism and low secretion of GH results in stunted growth resulting in pituitary dwarﬁsm. Excess secretion of growth hormone in adults especially in middle age can result in severe disﬁgurement (especially of the face) called Acromegaly, which may lead to serious complications, and premature death if unchecked. The disease is hard to diagnose in the early stages and often goes undetected for many years, until changes in external features become noticeable. Prolactin regulates the growth of the mammary glands and formation of milk in them. TSH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. ACTH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones called glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. LH and FSH stimulate gonadal activity and hence are called gonadotrophins. In males, LH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of hormones called androgens from testis. In males, FSH and androgens regulate spermatogenesis. In females, LH induces ovulation of fully mature follicles (graaﬁan follicles) and maintains the corpus luteum, formed from the remnants of the graaﬁan follicles"

biology/,"Chapter 5 Morphology of Flowering Plants Chapter 6 Anatomy of Flowering Plants Chapter 7 Structural Organisation in Animals UNIT 2 STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN PLANTS AND ANIMALS The description of the diverse forms of life on earth was made only by observation — through naked eyes or later through magnifying lenses and microscopes. This description is mainly of gross structural features, both external and internal. In addition, observable and perceivable living phenomena were also recorded as part of this description. Before experimental biology or more speciﬁcally, physiology, was established as a part of biology, naturalists described only biology. Hence, biology remained as a natural history for a long time. The description, by itself, was amazing in terms of detail. While the initial reaction of a student could be boredom, one should keep in mind that the detailed description, was utilised in the later day reductionist biology where living processes drew more attention from scientists than the description of life forms and their structure. Hence, this description became meaningful and helpful in framing research questions in physiology or evolutionary biology. In the following chapters of this unit, the structural organisation of plants and animals, including the structural basis of physiologial or behavioural phenomena, is described. For convenience, this description of morphological and anatomical features is presented separately for plants and animals. 2019—2020"

Inner membrane Majority of the chloroplasts of the green plants are found in the mesophyll cells of the leaves. These are lens-shaped, oval, ThylakOid spherical, discoid or even ribbon-like Stroma organelles having variable length (5- lOum) lamella and width (2-4um). Their number varies from 1 per cell of the Chlamydomonas, a green alga to 20-40 per cell in the mesophyll. Like mitochondria, the chloroplasts are also double membrane bound. Of the two, the inner chloroplast membrane is relatively less permeable. The space limited by the inner membrane of the chloroplast is called the stroma. A number of organised ﬂattened membranous sacs called the thylakoids, are present in the stroma (Figure 8.8). Thylakoids are arranged in stacks like the piles of coins called grana (singular: granum) or the intergranal thylakoids. In addition, there are ﬂat membranous tubules called the stroma lamellae connecting the thylakoids of the different grana. The membrane of the thylakoids enclose a space called a lumen. The stroma of the chloroplast contains enzymes required for the synthesis of carbohydrates and proteins. It also contains small, double- stranded circular DNA molecules and ribosomes. Chlorophyll pigments are present in the thylakoids. The ribosomes of the chloroplasts are smaller (708) than the cytoplasmic ribosomes (808). 8.5.6 Ribosomes Ribosomes are the granular structures ﬁrst observed under the electron microscope as dense particles by George Palade (1953). They are Largﬁ composed of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proteins and subunit are not surrounded by any membrane. The eukaryotic ribosomes are 808 while the Small 7 prokaryotic ribosomes are 708. Each ribosome has two "" ' subunits, larger and smaller subunits (Fig 8.9). The two subunit Figure 8.9 Ribosome subunits of 808 ribosomes are 608 and 408 while that of 708 ribosomes are 508 and 308.

physics/,"162 PIIYSICS vary from one point of the body to the other. If the body is so extended that g varies from part to part of the body, then the centre of gravity and centre of mass will not coincide. Basically, the two are different concepts. The centre of mass has nothing to do with gravity. It depends only on the distribution of mass of the body. In Sec. 7.2 we found out the position of the centre of mass of several regular, homogeneous objects. Obviously the method used there gives us also the centre of gravity of these bodies, if they are small enough. Figure 7.25 illustrates another way of determining the CG of an irregular shaped body like a cardboard. If you suspend the body from some point like A, the vertical line through A passes through the CG. We mark the vertical AAl. We then suspend the body through other points like B and C. The intersection of the verticals gives the CG. Explain why the method works. Since the body is small enough, the method allows us to determine also its centre of mass. bExample 7.8 A metal bar 70 cm long and 4.00 kg in mass supported on two knife-edges placed 10 cm from each end. A 6.00 kg load is suspended at 30 cm from one end. Find the reactions at the knife— edges. (Assume the bar to be of uniform cross section and homogeneous.) Figure 7.26 shows the rod AB, the positions of the knife edges K1 and K2 , the centre of gravity of the rod at G and the suspended load at P. Note the weight of the rod W acts at its centre of gravity G. The rod is uniform in cross section and homogeneous; hence G is at the centre of the rod; AB = 70 cm. AG = 35 cm, AP = 30 cm, PG = 5 cm, AK1= BK2= 10 cm and KlG = K2G = 25 cm. Also, W= weight of the rod = 2019-20 4.00 kg and W1: suspended load = 6.00 kg; R1 and R2 are the normal reactions of the support at the knife edges. For translational equilibrium of the rod, R1+R2 —W1 —W = 0 (i) Note W1 and W act vertically down and R1 and R2 act vertically up. For considering rotational equilibrium, we take moments of the forces. A convenient point to take moments about is G. The moments of R2 and W1 are anticlockwise (+ve), whereas the moment of R1 is clockwise (-ve). For rotational equilibrium, —R1(K1G) + W1 (PG) + R2 (KZG) = 0 (ii) It is given that W: 4.009 N and W1 = 6.009 N, where 9 = acceleration due to gravity. We take 9 = 9.8 m/s2.

physics/,"LAWS OF MOTION 91 In practice, the ball does come to a stop after moving a finite distance on the horizontal plane, because of the opposing force of friction which can never be totally eliminated. However, if there were no friction, the ball would continue to move with a constant velocity on the horizontal plane. Galileo thus, arrived at a new insight on motion that had eluded Aristotle and those who followed him. The state of rest and the state of uniform linear motion (motion with constant velocity) are equivalent. In both cases, there is accomplished almost single-handedly by Isaac Newton, one of the greatest scientists of all times. Newton built on Galileo’s ideas and laid the foundation of mechanics in terms of three laws of motion that go by his name. Galileo’s law of inertia was his starting point which he formulated as the first law of motion: Every body continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise. Ideas on Motion in Ancient Indian Science Ancient Indian thinkers had arrived at an elaborate system of ideas on motion. Force. the cause of motion. was thought to be of diﬁerent kinds : force due to continuous pressure [nodan]. as the force of wind on a sailing vessel; impact [abhighat). as when a potter's rod strikes the wheel: persistent tendency [sanskara] to move in a straight line(vega) or restoration of shape in an elastic body: transmitted force by a string. rod. etc. The notion of (vega) in the Vaisesika theory of motion perhaps comes closest to the concept of inertia. Vega. the tendency to move in a straight line. was thought to be opposed by contact with objects including atmosphere. a parallel to the ideas of friction and air resistance. It was correctly summarised that the different kinds of motion (translational. rotational and vibrational) of an extended body arise from only the translational motion of its constituent particles. A falling leaf in the wind may have downward motion as a whole [patan) and also rotational and vibrational motion [bhraman. spandan). but each particle of the leaf at an instant only has a deﬁnite (small) displacement. There was considerable focus in Indian thought on measurement of motion and units of length and time. It was known that the position of a particle in space can be indicated by distance measured along three axes. Bhaskara [1150 AD.) had introduced the concept of ‘instantaneous motion' [tatkaliki gati']. which anticipated the modem notion of instantaneous velocity using Differential Calculus. The difference between a wave and a current (of water) was clearly understood: a current is a motion of particles of water under gravity and ﬂuidity while a wave results no net force acting on the body. It is incorrect to assume that a net force is needed to keep a body in uniform motion. To maintain a body in uniform motion, we need to apply an external force to ecounter the frictional force, so that the two forces sum up to zero net external force. To summarise, if the net external force is zero, a body at rest continues to remain at rest and a body in motion continues to move with a uniform velocity. This property of the body is called inertia. Inertia means ‘resistance to change’. A body does not change its state of rest or uniform motion, unless an external force compels it to change that state. 5.4 NEWTON'S FIRST LAW OF MOTION Galileo’s simple, but revolutionary ideas dethroned Aristotelian mechanics. A new mechanics had to be developed. This task was from the transmission of vibrations of water particles. The state of rest or uniform linear motion both imply zero acceleration. The first law of motion can, therefore, be simply expressed as: If the net external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero. Acceleration can be non zero only if there is a net external force on the body. Two kinds of situations are encountered in the application of this law in practice. In some examples, we know that the net external force on the object is zero. In that case we can conclude that the acceleration of the object is zero. For example, a spaceship out in interstellar space, far from all other objects and with all its rockets turned off, has no net external force acting on it. Its acceleration, according to the first law, must be zero. If it is in motion, it must continue to move with a uniform velocity. 2019-20"
biology/,"BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 23 called conidia or sporangiospores or zoospores, and sexual reproduction is by oospores, ascospores and basidiospores. The various spores are produced in distinct structures called fruiting bodies. The sexual cycle involves the following three steps: (i) Fusion of protoplasms between two motile or non-motile gametes called plasmogamy. (ii) Fusion of two nuclei called karyogamy. (iii) Meiosis in zygote resulting in haploid spores. When a fungus reproduces sexually, two haploid hyphae of compatible mating types come together and fuse. In some fungi the fusion of two haploid cells immediately results in diploid cells (2n). However, in other fungi (ascomycetes and basidiomycetes), an intervening dikaryotic stage (n + n, i.e., two nuclei per cell) occurs; such a condition is called a dikaryon and the phase is called dikaryophase of fungus. Later, the parental nuclei fuse and the cells become diploid. The fungi form fruiting bodies in which reduction division occurs, leading to formation of haploid spores. The morphology of the mycelium, mode of spore formation and fruiting bodies form the basis for the division of the kingdom into various classes. 2.3. 1 Phycomycetes Members of phycomycetes are found in aquatic habitats and on decaying wood in moist and damp places or as obligate parasites on plants. The mycelium is aseptate and coenocytic. Asexual reproduction takes place by zoospores (motile) or by aplanospores (non-motile). These spores are endogenously produced in sporangium. A zygospore is formed by fusion of two gametes. These gametes are similar in morphology (isogamous) or dissimilar (anisogamous or oogamous). Some common examples are Mucor (Figure 2.5a), Rhizopus (the bread mould mentioned earlier) and Albugo (the parasitic fungi on mustard). 2.3.2 Ascomycetes Commonly known as sac-fungi, the ascomycetes are mostly multicellular, e. g., Penicillium or rarely unicellular, e. g., yeast (Saccharomyces).

A central force is such that the force on the planet is along the vector joining the Sun and the planet. Let the Sun be at the origin and let the position and momentum of the planet be denoted by r and p respectively. Then the area swept out by the planet of mass m in time interval At is (Fig. 8.2) AA given by AA = 1/2 (r x vAt) (8.1) Hence AA/At =1/2 (r x p)/m, (since v = p/m) = L / (2 m) (8.2) where v is the velocity, L is the angular momentum equal to ( r x p). For a central force, which is directed along r, L is a constant Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) was a scientist of German origin. He formulated the three laws of planetary motion based on the painstaking : observations of Tycho Brahe and coworkers. Kepler himself was an assistant to Brahe and it took him sixteen long years to arrive at the three planetary laws. He is also known as the founder of geometrical optics. being the ﬁrst to describe what happens to light after it enters a telescope. Refer to information given in the Box on Page 182 as the planet goes around. Hence, AA /At is a constant according to the last equation. This is the law of areas. Gravitation is a central force and hence the law of areas follows. Example 8.1 Let the speed of the planet at the perihelion Pin Fig. 8.1(a) be up and the Sun—planet distance SP be rp. Relate {rp. up} to the corresponding quantities at the aphelion {rA DA}. Will the planet take equal times to traverse BAC and CPB ? Answer The magnitude of the angular momentum at Pis L1) = up, since inspection tells us that rp and v1) are mutually perpendicular. Similarly, LA = mp rA DA. From angular momentum conservation TTIPTPUP=H1PTAUA U_P_TA or _ 4 DA rp Since rA > rp, up > vA. The area SBAC bounded by the ellipse and the radius vectors SB and SC is larger than SBPC in Fig. 8. 1. From Kepler’s second law, equal areas are swept in equal times. Hence the planet will take a longer time to traverse BAC than CPB. 8.3 UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION Legend has it that observing an apple falling from a tree, Newton was inspired to arrive at an universal law of gravitation that led to an explanation of terrestrial gravitation as well as of Kepler’s laws. Newton’s reasoning was that the moon revolving in an orbit of radius Rm was subject to a centripetal acceleration due to earth’s gravity of magnitude V2 4722Rm am 2 — : 2 (8.3) Rm T where V is the speed of the moon related to the time period T by the relation V = 271'Rm / T. The time period T is about 27.3 days and Rm was already known then to be about 3.84 X 108m. If we substitute these numbers in Eq. (8.3), we get a value of am much smaller than the value of acceleration due to gravity g on the surface of the earth, arising also due to earth’s gravitational attraction. 2019-20"
geography/,"GEOGRAPHY AS A DISCIPLINE through oceans. The geographical factors have modiﬁed the course of history in different parts of the world. Every geographical phenomenon undergoes change through time and can be explained temporally. The changes in landforms, climate, vegetation, economic activities occupations and cultural developments have followed a definite historical course. Many geographical features result from the decision making process by different institutions at a particular point of time. It is possible to convert time in terms of space and space in terms of time. For example, it can be said that place A is 1,500 km from place B or alternately, it can also be said that place A is two hours away (if one travels by plane) or seventeen hours away (if one travels by a fast moving train). It is for this reason, time is an integral part of geographical studies as the fourth dimension. Please mention other three dimensions? Figure1.1 amply depicts the linkages of geography with different natural and social sciences. This linkage can be put under two segments. Physical Geography and Natural Sciences All the branches of physical geography, as shown in Figure 1.1, have interface with natural sciences. The traditional physical geography is linked with geology, meteorology, hydrology and pedology, and thus, geomorphology, climatology, oceanography and soil geography respectively have very close link with the natural sciences as these derive their data from these sciences. Bio- Geography is closely related to botany, zoology as well as ecology as human beings are located in different locational niche. A geographer should have some proﬁciency in mathematics and art, particularly in drawing maps. Geography is very much linked with the study of astronomical locations and deals with latitudes and longitudes. The shape of the earth is Geoid but the basic tool of a geographer is a map which is two dimensional representation of the earth. The problem of converting geoids into two dimensions can be tackled by projections constructed graphically or mathematically. The cartographic and quantitative techniques require sufficient proficiency in mathematics, statistics and 5 econometrics. Maps are prepared through artistic imagination. Making sketches, mental maps and cartographic work require proficiency in arts. Geography and Social Sciences Each social science sketched in Figure 1.1 has interface with one branch of geography. The relationships between geography and history have already been outlined in detail. Every discipline has a philosophy which is the raison d’etre for that discipline. Philosophy provides roots to a discipline and in the process of its evolution, it also experiences distinct historical processes. Thus, the history of geographical thought as mother branch of geography is included universally in its curricula. All the social science disciplines, viz. sociology, political science, economics and demography study different aspects of social reality. The branches of geography, viz. social, political, economic and population and settlements are closely linked with these disciplines as each one of them has spatial attributes. The core concern of political science is territory, people and sovereignty while political geography is also interested in the study of the state as a spatial unit as well as people and their political behaviour. Economics deals with basic attributes of the economy such as production, distribution, exchange and consumption. Each of these attributes also has spatial aspects and here comes the role of economic geography to study the spatial aspects of production, distribution, exchange and consumption. Likewise, population geography is closely linked with the discipline of demography. The above discussion shows that geography has strong interface with natural and social sciences. It follows its own methodology of study which makes it distinct from others. It has osmotic relationship with other disciplines. While all the disciplines have their own individual scope, this individuality does not obstruct the ﬂow of information as in case of all cells in the body that have individual identity separated by membranes but the ﬂow of blood is not obstructed.

physics/,"SYSTEMS OI’ PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 7.11 7.20 7.21 Torques of equal magnitude are applied to a hollow cylinder and a solid sphere, both having the same mass and radius. The cylinder is free to rotate about its standard axis of symmetry, and the sphere is free to rotate about an axis passing through its centre. Which of the two will acquire a greater angular speed after a given time. A solid cylinder of mass 20 kg rotates about its axis with angular speed 100 rad S"" 1. The radius of the cylinder is 0.25 m. What is the kinetic energy associated with the rotation of the cylinder? What is the magnitude of angular momentum of the cylinder about its axis? [a] A child stands at the centre of a turntable with his two arms outstretched. The turntable is set rotating with an angular speed of 40 rev/ min. How much is the angular speed of the child if he folds his hands back and thereby reduces his moment of inertia to 2/5 times the initial value ? Assume that the turntable rotates without friction. [b] Show that the child’s new kinetic energy of rotation is more than the initial kinetic energy of rotation. How do you account for this increase in kinetic energy? A rope of negligible mass is wound round a hollow cylinder of mass 3 kg and radius 40 cm. What is the angular acceleration of the cylinder if the rope is pulled with a force of 30 N ? What is the linear acceleration of the rope ? Assume that there is no slipping. To maintain a rotor at a uniform angular speed of 200 rad s‘l, an engine needs to transmit a torque of 180 N m. What is the power required by the engine ? (Note: uniform angular velocity in the absence of friction implies zero torque. In practice, applied torque is needed to counter frictional torque). Assume that the engine is 100% efficient. From a uniform disk of radius R, a circular hole of radius R/ 2 is cut out. The centre of the hole is at R/ 2 from the centre of the original disc. Locate the centre of gravity of the resulting ﬂat body. A metre stick is balanced on a knife edge at its centre. When two coins, each of mass 5 g are put one on top of the other at the 12.0 cm mark, the stick is found to be balanced at 45.0 cm. What is the mass of the metre stick? A solid sphere rolls down two different inclined planes of the same heights but different angles of inclination. (a) Will it reach the bottom with the same speed in each case? [b] Will it take longer to roll down one plane than the other? [c] If so, which one and why? A hoop of radius 2 m weighs 100 kg. It rolls along a horizontal ﬂoor so that its centre of mass has a speed of 20 cm/s. How much work has to be done to stop it? The oxygen molecule has a mass of 5.30 X 10’26 kg and a moment of inertia of 1.94><10’46 kg m2 about an axis through its centre perpendicular to the lines joining the two atoms. Suppose the mean speed of such a molecule in a gas is 500 m / s and that its kinetic energy of rotation is two thirds of its kinetic energy of translation. Find the average angular velocity of the molecule. A solid cylinder rolls up an inclined plane of angle of inclination 30°.

geography/,"ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION AND WEATHER SYSTEMS which is not present in the tropical cyclones. They cover a larger area and can originate over the land and sea. Whereas the tropical cyclones originate only over the seas and on reaching the land they dissipate. The extra tropical cyclone affects a much larger area as compared to the tropical cyclone. The wind velocity in a tropical cyclone is much higher and it is more destructive. The extra tropical cyclones move from west to east but tropical cyclones, move from east to west. Tropical Cyclones Tropical cyclones are violent storms that originate over oceans in tropical areas and move over to the coastal areas bringing about large scale destruction caused by violent winds, very heavy rainfall and storm surges. This is one of the most devastating natural calamities. They are known as Cyclones in the Indian Ocean, Hurricanes in the Atlantic, Typhoons in the Western Pacific and South China Sea, and Willy-willies in the Western Australia. Tropical cyclones originate and intensify over warm tropical oceans. The conditions favourable for the formation and intensiﬁcation of tropical storms are: (i) Large sea surface with temperature higher than 27° C; (ii) Presence of the Coriolis force; (iii) Small variations in the vertical wind speed; (iv) A pre-existing weak- low-pressure area or low-level-cyclonic circulation; (v) Upper divergence above the sea level system. The energy that intensiﬁes the storm, comes from the condensation process in the towering cumulonimbus clouds, surrounding the centre of the storm. With continuous supply of moisture from the sea, the storm is further strengthened. On reaching the land the moisture supply is cut off and the storm dissipates. The place where a tropical cyclone crosses the coast is called the landfall of the cyclone. The cyclones, which cross 20° N latitude generally, recurve and they are more destructive. 91 A schematic representation of the vertical structure of a mature tropical cyclonic storm is shown in Figure 10.10. A mature tropical cyclone is characterised by the strong spirally circulating wind around the centre, called the eye. The diameter of the circulating system can vary between 1 50 and 250 km. The eye is a region of calm with subsiding air. Around the eye is the eye wall, where there is a strong spiralling ascent of air to greater height reaching the tropopause. The wind reaches maximum velocity in this region, reaching as high as 250 km per hour. Torrential rain occurs here. From the eye wall rain bands may radiate and trains of cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds may drift into the outer region. The diameter of the storm over the Bay of Bengal, Arabian sea and Indian ocean is between 600 - 1200 km. The system moves slowly about 300 - 500 km per day. The cyclone creates storm surges and they inundate the coastal low lands. The storm peters out on the land.

biology/,"LOCOMOT ION AND MOVEMENT called locomotion. Animals move generally in search of food, shelter, mate, breeding ground, better climate or to protect themselves. The cells of the human body exhibit amoeboid, ciliary and muscular movements. Locomotion and many other movements require coordinated muscular activities. Three types of muscles are present in our body. Skeletal muscles are attached to skeletal elements. They appear striated and are voluntary in nature. Visceral muscles, present in the inner walls of visceral organs are nonstriated and involuntary. Cardiac muscles are the muscles of the heart. They are striated, branched and involuntary. Muscles possess excitability, contractility, extensibility and elasticity. Muscle ﬁbre is the anatomical unit of muscle. Each muscle ﬁbre has many parallelly arranged myoﬁbrils. Each myoﬁbril contains many serially arranged units called sarcomere which are the functional units. Each sarcomere has a central ‘A’ band made of thick myosin ﬁlaments, and two half ‘1’ bands made of thin actin ﬁlaments on either side of it marked by ‘2’ lines.

Torque and angular momentum for a system of particles To get the total angular momentum of a system of particles about a given point we need to add vectorially the angular momenta of individual particles.

Then leave one string, say B, from your hand. and observe what happens. The rim keeps rotating in a vertical plane and the plane of rotation turns around the string A which you are holding. We say that the axis of rotation of the rim or equivalently its angular momentum precesses about the string A. The rotating rim gives rise to an angular momentum. Determine the direction of this angular momentum. When you are holding the rotating rim with string A. a torque is generated. [We leave it to you to ﬁnd out how the torque is generated and what its direction is.)

biology/,"CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION Cells at the end of prophase, when viewed under the microscope, do not show golgi complexes, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleolus and the nuclear envelope. 10.2.2 Metaphase The complete disintegration of the nuclear envelope marks the start of the second phase of mitosis, hence the chromosomes are spread through the cytoplasm of the cell. By this stage, condensation of chromosomes is completed and they can be observed clearly under the microscope. This then, is the stage at which morphology of chromosomes is most easily studied. At this stage, metaphase chromosome is made up of two sister chromatids, which are held together by the centromere (Figure 10.2 b). Small disc-shaped structures at the surface of the centromeres are called kinetochores. These structures serve as the sites of attachment of spindle fibres (formed by the spindle ﬁbres) to the chromosomes that are moved into position at the centre of the cell. Hence, the metaphase is characterised by all the chromosomes coming to lie at the equator with one chromatid of each chromosome connected by its kinetochore to spindle ﬁbres from one pole and its sister chromatid connected by its kinetochore to spindle ﬁbres from the opposite pole (Figure 10.2 b). The plane of alignment of the chromosomes at metaphase is referred to as the metaphase plate. The key features of metaphase are: 0 Spindle fibres attach to kinetochores of chromosomes. 0 Chromosomes are moved to spindle equator and get aligned along metaphase plate through spindle ﬁbres to both poles. 10.2.3 Anaphase At the onset of anaphase, each chromosome arranged at the metaphase plate is split simultaneously and the two daughter chromatids, now referred to as daughter chromosomes of the future daughter nuclei, begin their migration towards the two opposite poles. As each chromosome moves away ﬁom the equatorial plate, the centromere of each chromosome remains directed towards the pole and hence at the leading edge, with the arms of the chromosome trailing behind (Figure 10.2 0). Thus, anaphase stage is characterised by Early Prophase Transition to Metaphase Metaphase (b) Figure 10.2 a and b : A diagrammatic View of stages in mitosis"

Insulin also stimulates conversion of glucose to glycogen (glycogenesis) in the target cells. The glucose homeostasis in blood is thus maintained jointly by the two — insulin and glucagons. Prolonged hyperglycemia leads to a complex disorder called diabetes mellitus which is associated with loss of glucose through urine and formation of harmful compounds known as ketone bodies. Diabetic patients are successfully treated with insulin therapy. 22.2.9 Testis A pair of testis is present in the scrotal sac (outside abdomen) of male individuals (Figure 22.1). Testis performs dual functions as a primary sex organ as well as an endocrine gland. Testis is composed of seminiferous tubules and stromal or interstitial tissue. The Leydig cells or interstitial cells, which are present in the intertubular spaces produce a group of hormones called androgens mainly testosterone. Androgens regulate the development, maturation and functions of the male accessory sex organs like epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, urethra etc. These hormones stimulate muscular growth, growth of facial and axillary hair, aggressiveness, low pitch of voice etc. Androgens play a major stimulatory role in the process of sperrnatogenesis (formation of spermatozoa). Androgens act on the central neural system and inﬂuence the male sexual behaviour (libido). These hormones produce anabolic (synthetic) effects on protein and carbohydrate metabolism. 22.2. 10 Ovary Females have a pair of ovaries located in the abdomen (Figure 22.1). Ovary is the primary female sex organ which produces one ovum during each menstrual cycle. In addition, ovary also produces two groups of steroid hormones called estrogen and progesterone. Ovary is composed of ovarian follicles and stromal tissues. The estrogen is synthesised and secreted mainly by the growing ovarian follicles. After ovulation, the ruptured follicle is converted to a structure called corpus luteum, which secretes mainly progesterone.

geography/,"134 Figure 16.4 : Humbodtia decurrens Bedd — highly rare endemic tree of Southern Western Ghats (India) There is an urgent need to educate people to adopt environment-friendly practices and reorient their activities in such a way that our development is harmonious with other life forms and is sustainable. There is an increasing consciousness of the fact that such conservation with sustainable use is possible only with the involvement and cooperation of local communities and individuals. For this, the development of institutional structures at local levels is necessary. The critical problem is not merely the conservation of species nor the habitat but the continuation of process of conservation. The Government of India along with 155 other nations have signed the Convention of Biodiversity at the Earth Summit held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in June 1 992. The world conservation strategy has suggested the following steps for biodiversity conservation: (i) Efforts should be made to preserve the species that are endangered. (ii) Prevention of extinction requires proper planning and management. (iii) Varieties of food crops, forage plants, timber trees, livestock, animals and their wild relatives should be preserved; FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY (iv) Each country should identify habitats of wild relatives and ensure their protection. (v) Habitats where species feed, breed, rest and nurse their young should be safeguarded and protected. (vi) International trade in wild plants and animals be regulated. To protect, preserve and propagate the variety of species within natural boundaries, the Government of India passed the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, under which national parks and sanctuaries were established and biosphere reserves declared. Details of these biosphere reserves are given in the book India: Physical Environment (NCERT, 2006). There are some countries which are situated in the tropical region; they possess a large number of the world’s species diversity. They are called mega diversity centres. There are 12 such countries, namely Mexico, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia in which these centres are located. In order to concentrate resources on those areas that are most vulnerable, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) has identified certain areas as biodiversity hotspots (Figure 16.5). Hotspots are defined according to their vegetation. Plants are important because these determine the primary productivity of an ecosystem. Most, but not all, of the hotspots rely on species-rich ecosystems for food, firewood, cropland, and income from timber. In Madagascar, for example, about 85 per cent of the plants and animals are found nowhere else in the world, Other hotspots in wealthy countries are facing different types of pressures. The islands of Hawaii have many unique plants and animals that are threatened by introduced species and land development. 2019-2020"

Even though the angiosperms show such a large diversity in external structure or morphology, they are all characterised by presence of roots, stems, leaves, ﬂowers and fruits. In chapters 2 and 3, we talked about classification of plants based on morphological and other characteristics. For any successful attempt at classification and at understanding any higher plant (or for that matter any living organism) we need to know standard technical terms and standard definitions. We also need to know about the possible variations in different parts, found as adaptations of the plants to their environment, e. g. , adaptions to various habitats, for protection, climbing, storage, etc. If you pull out any weed you will see that all of them have roots, stems and leaves. They may be bearing ﬂowers and fruits. The underground part of the ﬂowering plant is the root system while the portion above the ground forms the shoot system (Figure 5.1). 5.1 THE ROOT In majority of the dicotyledonous plants, the direct elongation of the radicle leads to the formation of primary root which grows inside the soil.

physics/,"UNITS AND MEASUREMENT 29 zeroes appearing in the base number in the scientific notation are signiﬁcant. Each number in this case has four significant figures. Thus, in the scientific notation, no confusion arises about the trailing zero(s) in the base number a. They are always significant. (4) The scientific notation is ideal for reporting measurement. But if this is not adopted, we use the rules adopted in the preceding example : ' For a number greater than 1, without any decimal, the trailing zero(s) are not significant. ' For a number with a decimal, the trailing zero(s) are significant. (5) The digit 0 conventionally put on the left of a decimal for a number less than 1 (like 0.1250) is never significant. However, the zeroes at the end of such number are significant in a measurement. (6) The multiplying or dividing factors which are neither rounded numbers nor numbers representing measured values are exact and have infinite number of significant digits. For example in T=E or s = 27cr, the factor 2 is an exact number and it can be written as 2.0, 2.00 t or 2.0000 as required. Similarly, in ng’ n is an exact number. 2.7. 1 Rules for Arithmetic Operations with Signiﬁcant Figures The result of a calculation involving approximate measured values of quantities (i.e. values with limited number of significant ﬁgures) must reﬂect the uncertainties in the original measured values. It cannot be more accurate than the original measured values themselves on which the result is based. In general, the final result should not have more significant figures than the original data from which it was obtained. Thus, if mass of an object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and its volume is measured to be 2.5 1 cm3, then its density, by mere arithmetic division, is 1 .6880478087 6 g/cm3 upto 1 1 decimal places. It would be clearly absurd and irrelevant to record the calculated value of density to such a precision when the measurements on which the value is based, have much less precision. The following rules for arithmetic operations with signiﬁcant figures ensure that the final result of a calculation is shown with the precision that is consistent with the precision of the input measured values : (1) In multiplication or division, the final result should retain as many significant figures as are there in the original number with the least significant figures. Thus, in the example above, density should be reported to three significant figures. 4.237g Density 2 2.51 cm 3 = 1.69 g cm'3 Similarly, if the speed of light is given as 3 x 108 m s1 (one significant figure) and one year (1y = 365.25 d) has 3.1557 x 107 s (ﬁve signiﬁcant figures), the light year is 9.47 x 1015 m (three significant figures). (2) In addition or subtraction, the final result should retain as many decimal places as are there in the number with the least decimal places. For example, the sum of the numbers 436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g by mere arithmetic addition, is 663.821 g. But the least precise measurement (227 .2 g) is correct to only one decimal place. The final result should, therefore, be rounded off to 663.8 g. Similarly, the difference in length can be expressed as : 0.307 m — 0.304 m = 0.003 m = 3 X 10‘3 m. Note that we should not use the rule (1) applicable for multiplication and division and write 664 g as the result in the example of addition and 3.00 x 10'3 m in the example of subtraction. They do not convey the precision of measurement properly. For addition and subtraction, the rule is in terms of decimal places. 2.7.2 Rounding off the Uncertain Digits The result of computation with approximate numbers, which contain more than one uncertain digit, should be rounded off. The rules for rounding off numbers to the appropriate significant figures are obvious in most cases. A number 2.746 rounded off to three significant figures is 2.75, while the number 2.743 would be 2.74. The rule by convention is that the preceding digit is raised by 1 if the 2019-20"

Protonephridia are primarily concerned with ionic and ﬂuid volume regulation, i.e., osmoregulation. Nephridia are the tubular excretory structures of earthworms and other annelids. Nephridia help to remove nitrogenous wastes and maintain a ﬂuid and ionic balance. Malpighian tubules are the excretory structures of most of the insects including cockroaches. Malpighian tubules help in the removal of nitrogenous wastes and osmoregulation. Antennal glands or green glands perform the excretory function in crustaceans like prawns. 19. 1 HUMAN EXCRETORY SYSTEM In humans, the excretory system consists of a pair of kidneys, one pair of ureters, a urinary bladder and a urethra (Figure 19.1). Kidneys are reddish brown, bean Adrenal gland shaped structures situated between the levels of last thoracic and third lumbar velrrllalegga Renal artery vertebra close to the dorsal inner wall of , , Renal vem the abdominal cavity. Each kidney of an PelWS adult human measures 10- 12 cm in length, 5-7 cm in width, 2-3 cm in thickness with an average weight of 120- 170 g. Towards the centre of the inner concave surface of the kidney is a notch called hilum through which ureter, blood vessels and nerves enter. Inner to the hilum is a broad funnel shaped space called the Dorsal aorta Ureter renal pelvis with projections called calyces. 5:31? The outer layer of kidney is a tough a er Urethra capsule. Inside the kidney, there are two zones, an outer cortex and an inner medulla. The medulla is divided into a few conical masses (medullary pyramids) projecting into the calyces (sing: calyx).

biology/,"PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT The growth rate shows an increase that may be arithmetic or geometrical (Figure 15.4). In arithmetic growth, following mitotic cell division, only one daughter cell continues to divide while the other differentiates and matures. The simplest expression of arithmetic growth is exempliﬁed by a root elongating at a constant rate. Look at Figure 15.5. On plotting the length of the organ against time, a linear curve is obtained. Mathematically, it is expressed as E=g+n Lt = length at time ‘t’ L0 = length at time ‘zero’ r = growth rate / elongation per unit time. Let us now see what happens in geometrical growth. In most systems, the initial growth is slow (lag phase), and it increases rapidly thereafter — at an exponential rate (log or exponential phase). Here, both the progeny cells following mitotic cell division retain the ability to divide and continue to do so. However, with limited nutrient supply, the growth slows down leading to a stationary phase. If we plot the parameter of growth against time, we get a typical sigmoid or S—curve (Figure 15.6). A sigmoid curve is a characteristic of living organism growing in a natural environment. It is typical for all cells, tissues and organs of a plant. Can you think of more similar examples? What kind of a curve can you expect in a tree showing seasonal activities? The exponential growth can be expressed as W1 = WO ert W1 = ﬁnal size (weight, height, number etc.) WO = initial size at the beginning of the period r = growth rate t = time of growth e = base of natural logarithms Here, r is the relative growth rate and is also the measure of the ability of the plant to produce new plant material, referred to as efficiency index. Hence, the ﬁnal size of W1 depends on the initial size, W0. 243 Height of the plant Figure 15.5 Constant linear growth, a plot of length L against time t Stationary phase Size/weight of the organ Lag phase Time Figure 15.6 An idealised sigmoid growth curve typical of cells in culture, and many higher plants and plant organs"

If the two particles have the same mass m1 = m2 = m~ then mx1 + mx2 x1 + x2 X:—: 2m 2 Thus, for two particles of equal mass the centre of mass lies exactly midway between them.

We may define x— and y— axes in the plane in which the particles lie and represent the positions of the three particles by coordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2) and (x3,y3) respectively.

biology/,"250 BIOLOGY leaves, chloroplasts in leaves, lateral shoot growth and adventitious shoot formation. Cytokinins help overcome the apical dominance. They promote nutrient mobilisation which helps in the delay of leaf senescence. 1 5.4.3.4 Ethylene Ethylene is a simple gaseous PGR. It is synthesised in large amounts by tissues undergoing senescence and ripening fruits. Inﬂuences of ethylene on plants include horizontal growth of seedlings, swelling of the axis and apical hook formation in dicot seedlings. Ethylene promotes senescence and abscission of plant organs especially of leaves and ﬂowers. Ethylene is highly effective in fruit ripening. It enhances the respiration rate during ripening of the fruits. This rise in rate of respiration is called respiratory climactic. Ethylene breaks seed and bud dormancy, initiates germination in peanut seeds, sprouting of potato tubers. Ethylene promotes rapid internode / petiole elongation in deep water rice plants. It helps leaves / upper parts of the shoot to remain above water. Ethylene also promotes root growth and root hair formation, thus helping the plants to increase their absorption surface. Ethylene is used to initiate ﬂowering and for synchronising fruit-set in pineapples. It also induces ﬂowering in mango. Since ethylene regulates so many physiological processes, it is one of the most widely used PGR in agriculture. The most widely used compound as source of ethylene is ethephon. Ethephon in an aqueous solution is readily absorbed and transported within the plant and releases ethylene slowly. Ethephon hastens fruit ripening in tomatoes and apples and accelerates abscission in ﬂowers and fruits (thinning of cotton, cherry, walnut). It promotes female ﬂowers in cucumbers thereby increasing the yield. 1 5.4.3.5 Abscisic acid As mentioned earlier, abscisic acid (ABA) was discovered for its role in regulating abscission and dormancy. But like other PGRs, it also has other wide ranging effects on plant growth and development. It acts as a general plant growth inhibitor and an inhibitor of plant metabolism. ABA inhibits seed germination. ABA stimulates the closure of stomata and increases the tolerance of plants to various kinds of stresses. Therefore, it is also called the stress hormone. ABA plays an important role in seed development, maturation and dormancy. By inducing dormancy, ABA helps seeds to withstand desiccation and other factors unfavourable for growth. In most situations, ABA acts as an antagonist to GAs. We may summarise that for any and every phase of growth, differentiation and development of plants, one or the other PGR has some role to play. Such roles could be complimentary or antagonistic. These could be individualistic or synergistic."

biology/,"TRANSPORT IN PLANTS Let us discuss another experiment where a solution of sucrose in water taken in a funnel is separated from pure water in a beaker by a selectively permeable membrane (Figure 1 1.4). You can get this kind of a membrane in an egg. Remove the yolk and albumin through a small hole at one end of the egg, and place the shell in dilute solution of hydrochloric acid for a few hours. The egg shell dissolves leaving the membrane intact. Water will move into the funnel, resulting in rise in the level of the solution in the funnel. This will continue till the equilibrium is reached. In case sucrose does diffuse out through the membrane, will this equilibrium be ever reached? External pressure can be applied from the upper part of the funnel such that no water diffuses into the funnel through the membrane. This pressure required to prevent water from diffusing is in fact, the osmotic pressure and this is the function of the solute concentration; more the solute concentration, greater will be the pressure required to prevent water from diffusing in. Numerically osmotic pressure is equivalent to the osmotic potential, but the sign is opposite.Osmotic pressure is the positive pressure applied, while osmotic potential is negative. 1 1 .2 .3 Plasmolysis The behaviour of the plant cells (or tissues) with regard to water movement depends on the surrounding solution. If the external solution balances the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm, it is said to be isotonic. If the external solution is more dilute than the cytoplasm, it is hypotonic and if the external solution is more concentrated, it is hypertonic. Cells swell in hypotonic solutions and shrink in hypertonic ones. Plasmolysis occurs when water moves out of the cell and the cell membrane of a plant cell shrinks away from its cell wall. This occurs when 181 Pressure 1 Figure 11.4 A demonstration of osmosis. A thistle funnel is filled with sucrose solution and kept inverted in a beaker containing water.

We have already seen that the sound waves travel in the form of compressions and rarefactions of small volume elements of air. The elastic property that determines the stress under compressional strain is the bulk modulus of the medium deﬁned by (see Chapter 9) AP B = — AV/V (15.16) Here, the change in pressure AP produces a AV volumetric strain 7 . B has the same dimension as pressure and given in SI units in terms of pascal (Pa). The inertial property relevant for the propagation of wave is the mass density p, with dimensions [ML—3]. Simple inspection reveals that quantity B/ p has the relevant dimension: [M L‘1 T'2] [M L’s] Thus, if B and p are considered to be the only relevant physical quantities, =[L2 T'2] (15.17) v =0 5 (15.18) p where, as before, C is the undetermined constant from dimensional analysis. The exact derivation shows that C=1. Thus, the general formula for longitudinal waves in a medium is: v = — (15.19) For a linear medium, like a solid bar, the lateral expansion of the bar is negligible and we may consider it to be only under longitudinal strain. In that case, the relevant modulus of elasticity is Young’s modulus, which has the same dimension as the Bulk modulus. Dimensional analysis for this case is the same as before and yields a relation like Eq. (15.18). with an undetermined C, which the exact derivation shows to be unity. Thus, the speed of longitudinal waves in a solid bar is given by v = X (15.20) p where Y is the Young’s modulus of the material of the bar. Table 15.1 gives the speed of sound in some media.

Answer On an unbanked road, frictional force alone can provide the centripetal force needed to keep the cyclist moving on a circular turn without slipping. If the speed is too large, or if the turn is too sharp (i.e. of too small a radius) or both, the frictional force is not sufficient to provide the necessary centripetal force, and the cyclist slips.

You should now be able to handle a large variety of problems in mechanics. A typical problem in mechanics usually does not merely involve a single body under the action of given forces. More often, we will need to consider an assembly of different bodies exerting forces on each other. Besides, each body in the assembly experiences the force of gravity. When trying to solve a problem of this type, it is useful to remember the fact that we can choose any part of the assembly and apply the laws of motion to that part provided we include all forces on the chosen part due to the remaining parts of the assembly. We may call the chosen part of the assembly as the system and the remaining part of the assembly (plus any other agencies of forces) as the environment. We have followed the same 2019-20"
physics/,"130 PHYSICS An experiment on head-on collision In performing an experiment on collision on a horizontal surface, we face three difﬁculties. One, there will be friction and bodies will not travel with uniform velocities. Two, if two bodies of different sizes collide on a table, it would be difficult to arrange them for a head-on collision unless their centres of mass are at the same height above the surface. Three, it will be fairly difﬁcult to measure velocities of the two bodies just before and just after collision. By performing this experiment in a vertical direction, all the three difficulties vanish. Take two balls, one of which is heavier (basketball / football / volleyball) and the other lighter (tennis ball / rubber ball / table tennis ball). First take only the heavier ball and drop it vertically from some height, say 1 m. Note to which it rises. This gives the velocities near the ﬂoor or ground, just before and just after the bounce (by using 1)2 = 2 gh ). Hence you will get the coefficient of restitution. Now take the big ball and a small ball and hold them in your W hands one over the other, with the heavier ball below the lighter one, as shown here. Drop them together, taking care that they remain together while falling, and see what happens. You will find that the heavier ball rises less than when it was dropped alone, while the lighter one shoots up to about 3 m. With practice, you will be able to hold the ball properly so that the lighter ball rises vertically up and I does not ﬂy sideways. This is head-on collision. You can try to find the best combination of balls which gives you , the best effect. You can measure the masses on a standard balance.

physics/,"SYSTEMS OI’ PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 153 a circle with a centre C on the axis. The radius of the circle is r, the perpendicular distance of the point P from the axis. We also show the linear velocity vector v of the particle at P. It is along the tangent at P to the circle. Let P’ be the position of the particle after an interval of time At (Fig. 7.16). The angle PCP’ describes the angular displacement A0 of the particle in time At. The average angular velocity of the particle over the interval At is AO/ At. As At tends to zero (i.e. takes smaller and smaller values), the ratio AO/ At approaches a limit which is the instantaneous angular velocity d6/dt of the particle at the position P. We denote the instantaneous angular velocity by a) (the Greek letter omega). We know from our study of circular motion that the magnitude of linear velocity v of a particle moving in a circle is related to the angular velocity of the particle 60 by the simple relation 1) = wr, where r is the radius of the circle. We observe that at any given instant the relation v = (0T applies to all particles of the rigid body. Thus for a particle at a perpendicular distance ri from the fixed axis, the linear velocity at a given instant vi is given by vi = curl. (7.19) The index iruns from 1 to n, where n is the total number of particles of the body. For particles on the axis, r = 0 , and hence v = a) r = 0. Thus, particles on the axis are stationary. This verifies that the axis is ﬁxed. Note that we use the same angular velocity u) for all the particles. We therefore, refer to (o as the angular velocity of the whole body. We have characterised pure translation of a body by all parts of the body having the same velocity at any instant of time. Similarly, we may characterise pure rotation by all parts of the body having the same angular velocity at any instant of time. Note that this characterisation of the rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis is just another way of saying as in Sec. 7. 1 that each particle of the body moves in a circle, which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has the centre on the axis. In our discussion so far the angular velocity appears to be a scalar. In fact, it is a vector. We shall not justify this fact, but we shall accept it. For rotation about a fixed axis, the angular velocity vector lies along the axis of rotation, and points out in the direction in which a right handed screw would advance, if the head of the screw is rotated with the body. (See Fig. 7 . 17a). The magnitude of this vector is a): dQ/dt referred as above. Fig. 7.17 (a) If the head of a right handed screw rotates with the body, the screw advances in the direction of the angular velocity u). If the sense (clockwise or anticlockwise) of rotation of the body changes, so does the direction of a). Fig. 7.1 7 (b) The angular velocity vector on is directed along the ﬁxed axis as shown. The linear velocity of the particle at P is v = a) x r. It is perpendicular to both a) and r and is directed along the tangent to the circle described by the particle. We shall now look at what the vector product a) x r corresponds to. Refer to Fig. 7 . 17 (b) which is a part of Fig. 7.16 reproduced to show the path of the particle P. The figure shows the vector a) directed along the fixed (2—) axis and also the position vector r = op of the particle at P of the rigid body with respect to the origin 0.

Looking at plants have you ever wondered why and how there are so many shades of green in their leaves — even in the same plant? We can look for an answer to this question by trying to separate the leaf pigments of any green plant through paper chromatography. A chromatographic separation of the leaf pigments shows that the colour that we see in leaves is not due to a single pigment but due to four pigments: Chlorophyll a (bright or blue green in the chromatogram), chlorophyll b [yellow green), xanthophylls (yellow) and carotenoids (yellow to yellow-orange). Let us now see what roles various pigments play in photosynthesis. Pigments are substances that have an ability to absorb light, at speciﬁc wavelengths. Can you guess which is the most abundant plant pigment in the world? Let us study the graph showing the ability of chlorophyll a pigment to absorb lights of different wavelengths (Figure 13.3 a). Of course, you are familiar with the wavelength of the visible spectrum of light as well as the VIBGYOR. From Figure 13.3a can you determine the wavelength (colour of light) at which chlorophyll a shows the maximum absorption? Does it show another absorption peak at any other wavelengths too? If yes, which one? Now look at Figure 13.3b showing the wavelengths at which maximum photosynthesis occurs in a plant. Can you see that the wavelengths at which there is maximum absorption by chlorophyll a, i.e., in the blue and the red regions, also shows higher rate of photosynthesis. Hence, we can conclude that chlorophyll a is the chief pigment associated with photosynthesis. But by looking at Figure 13.3c can you say that there is a complete one-to-one overlap between the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a and the action spectrum of photosynthesis?"
physics/,"144 PHYSICS axis of rotation of such a fan has an oscillating (sidewise) movement in a horizontal plane about the vertical through the point at which the axis is pivoted (point 0 in Fig. 7 .5(b)). While the fan rotates and its axis moves sidewise, this point is fixed. Thus, in more general cases of rotation, such as the rotation of a top or a pedestal fan, one point and not one line, of the rigid body is fixed. In this case the axis is not fixed, though it always passes through the fixed point. In our study, however, we mostly deal with the simpler and special case of rotation in which one line (i.e. the axis) is ﬁxed. Fig. 7.6(a) Motion of a rigid body which is pure translation. Fig. 7.6(b) Motion of a rigid body which is a combination of translation and rotation. Fig 7.6 (a) and 7.6 (b) illustrate different motions of the same body. Note P is an arbitrary point of the body; 0 is the centre of mass of the body, which is deﬁned in the next section. Sufﬁce to say here that the trajectories of O are the translational trajectories Trl and Tr2 of the body. The positions 0 and P at three different instants of time are shown by 01, 02, and 03, and P1, P2 and P3, respectively, in both Figs. 7.6 (a) and (b) . As seenfrom Fig. 7.6(a), at any instant the velocities of any particles like 0 and P of the body are the same in pure translation. Notice, in this case the orientation of OP, i. e. the angle OP makes with a fixed direction, say the horizontal, remains the same, i.e. a1 = a2 = a3. Fig. 7.6 (b) illustrates a case of combination of translation and rotation. In this case, at any instants the velocities of O and P differ. Also, (11, a2 and as may all be different. 2019-20 Thus, for us rotation will be about a fixed axis only unless stated otherwise. The rolling motion of a cylinder down an inclined plane is a combination of rotation about a fixed axis and translation. Thus, the ‘something else’ in the case of rolling motion which we referred to earlier is rotational motion. You will find Fig. 7 .6(a) and (b) instructive from this point of view. Both these figures show motion of the same body along identical translational trajectory. In one case, Fig. 7 .6(a), the motion is a pure translation; in the other case [Fig. 7.6(b)] it is a combination of translation and rotation. (You may try to reproduce the two types of motion shown, using a rigid object like a heavy book.) We now recapitulate the most important observations of the present section: The motion of a rigid body which is not pivoted or ﬁxed in some way is either a pure translation or a combination of translation and rotation. The motion of a rigid body which is pivoted or ﬁxed in some way is rotation. The rotation may be about an axis that is fixed (e.g. a ceiling fan) or moving (e. g. an oscillating table fan [Fig.7 .5(b)]). We shall, in the present chapter, consider rotational motion about a fixed axis only. 7.2 CENTRE OF MASS We shall first see what the centre of mass of a system of particles is and then discuss its significance. For simplicity we shall start with a two particle system. We shall take the line joining the two particles to be the x— axis.

Towards the end of the season, late or hard bark is formed. Name the various kinds of cell layers which constitute the bark. (a) At certain regions, the phellogen cuts off closely arranged parenchymatous cells on the outer side instead of cork cells.

Water is present in the atmosphere in three forms namely — gaseous, liquid and solid. The moisture in the atmosphere is derived from water bodies through evaporation and from plants through transpiration. Thus, there is a continuous exchange of water between the atmosphere, the oceans and the continents through the processes of evaporation, transpiration, condensation and precipitation. Water vapour present in the air is known as humidity. It is expressed quantitatively in different ways. The actual amount of the water vapour present in the atmosphere is known as the absolute humidity. It is the weight of water vapour per unit volume of air and is expressed in terms of grams per cubic metre. The ability of the air to hold water vapour depends entirely on its temperature. The absolute humidity differs from place to place on the surface of the earth. The percentage of moisture present in the atmosphere as compared to its full capacity at a given temperature is known as the relative humidity. With the change of air temperature, the capacity to retain moisture increases or decreases and the relative humidity is also affected. It is greater over the oceans and least over the continents. The air containing moisture to its full capacity at a given temperature is said to be saturated. It means that the air at the given temperature is incapable of holding any additional amount of moisture at that stage. The temperature at which saturation occurs in a given sample of air is known as dew point.

Evaporation is a process by which water is transformed from liquid to gaseous state. Heat is the main cause for evaporation. The temperature at which the water starts evaporating is referred to as the latent heat of vapourisation. Increase in temperature increases water absorption and retention capacity of the given parcel of air. Similarly, if the moisture content is low, air has a potentiality of absorbing and retaining moisture. Movement of air replaces the saturated layer with the unsaturated layer. Hence, the greater the movement of air, the greater is the evaporation. The transformation of water vapour into water is called condensation. Condensation is caused by the loss of heat. When moist air is cooled, it may reach a level when its capacity to hold water vapour ceases. Then, the excess water vapour condenses into liquid form. If it directly condenses into solid form, it is known as sublimation In free air, condensation results from cooling around very small particles termed as hygroscopic condensation nuclei. Particles of dust, smoke and salt from the ocean are particularly good nuclei because they absorb water. Condensation also takes place when the moist air comes in contact with some colder object and it may also take place when the temperature is close to the dew point.

Why does it happen ? This is because the air drag and the friction at the support oppose the motion of the pendulum and dissipate its energy gradually. The pendulum is said to execute damped oscillations. In dampled oscillations, the energy of the system is dissipated continuously; but, for small damping, the oscillations remain approximately periodic. The dissipating forces are generally the frictional forces. To understand the effect of such external forces on the motion of an oscillator, let us consider a system as shown in Fig. 14.19. Here a block of mass m connected to an elastic spring of spring constant k oscillates vertically. If the block is pushed down a little and released, its angular frequency of k oscillation is (0: a , as seen in Eq. (14.20). However, in practice, the surrounding medium (air) will exert a damping force on the motion of the block and the mechanical energy of the block-spring system will decrease. The energy loss will appear as heat of the surrounding medium (and the block also) [Fig. 14.19]. x Rigid support Spring BI9'Ck ..-.-.:.- .32: ' Surrounding ‘ -, medium ._ x' Fig. 1 4. 1 9 The viscous surrounding medium exerts a damping force on an oscillating spring, eventually bringing it to rest. 2019-20"

biology/,"LOCOMOT ION AND MOVEMENT Muscle contraction is initiated by a signal sent by the central nervous system (CNS) via a motor neuron. A motor neuron alongwith the muscle ﬁbres connected to it constitute a motor unit. The junction between a motor neuron and the sarcolemma of the muscle ﬁbre is called the neuromuscular junction or motor-end plate. A neural signal reaching this j unction releases a neurotransmitter (Acetyl choline) which generates an action potential in the sarcolemma. This spreads through the muscle ﬁbre and causes the release of calcium ions into the sarcoplasm. Increase in CaH level leads to the binding of calcium with a subunit of troponin on actin ﬁlaments and thereby remove the masking of active sites for myosin. Utilising the energy from ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head now binds to the exposed active sites on actin to form a cross bridge (Figure 20.4). This Myosin head (Formation of cross bridge) / Figure 20.4 Stages in cross bridge formation, rotation of head and breaking of cross bridge Sliding / rotation pulls the attached actin ﬁlaments towards the centre of ‘A’ band. The ‘2’ line attached to these actins are also pulled inwards thereby causing a shortening of the sarcomere, i.e., contraction. It is clear from the above steps, that during shortening of the muscle, i.e., contraction, the ‘1’ bands get reduced, whereas the ‘A’ bands retain the length (Figure 20.5). The myosin, releasing the ADP and P1 goes back to its relaxed state. A new ATP binds and the cross-bridge is broken (Figure 20.4). The ATP is again hydrolysed by the myosin head and the cycle of cross bridge formation"

She reported in her early publications that the curly top virus spreads through a plant via the food- conducting or phloem tissue. Dr Esau’s PlantAnatomy published in 1954 took a dynamic, developmental approach designed to enhance one’s understanding of plant structure and an enormous impact worldwide, literally bringing about a revival of the discipline. The Anatomy of Seed Plants by Katherine Esau was published in 1960. It was referred to as Webster’s of plant biology — it is encyclopediac. In 1957 she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, becoming the sixth woman to receive that honour. In addition to this prestigious award, she received the National Medal of Science from President George Bush in 1989.

physics/,"270 PIlYSlCS > Example 10.1 1 The lower end of a capillary tube of diameter 2.00 mm is dipped 8.00 cm below the surface of water in a beaker. What is the pressure required in the tube in order to blow a hemispherical bubble at its end in water? The surface tension of water at temperature of the experiments is 7.30><10'2 Nm‘l. l atmospheric pressure = 1.01 X 105 Pa. density ofwater = 1000 kg/m“. g = 9.80 m s2. Also calculate the excess pressure. AnswerThe excess pressure in a bubble of gas in a liquid is given by 28/ r, where S is the surface tension of the liquid-gas interface. You should note there is only one liquid surface in this case. (For a bubble of liquid in a gas, there are two liquid surfaces, so the formula for excess pressure in that case is 4S/r.) The radius of the bubble is r. Now the pressure outside the bubble P0 equals atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to 8.00 cm of water column. That is P0 = (1.01 X 105 Pa + 0.08 m X 1000 kg m‘3 X 9.80 m S'Z) = 1.01784 X 105 Pa Therefore, the pressure inside the bubble is Pi = P0 + ZS/r = 1.01784X 105 Pa+ (2 X 7.3 X 10'2 Pa m/ 10'3 m) = (1.01784 + 0.00146) X 105 Pa = 1.02 X 105 Pa where the radius of the bubble is taken to be equal to the radius of the capillary tube, since the bubble is hemispherical ! (The answer has been rounded off to three significant figures.) The excess pressure in the bubble is 146 Pa. 4 SUMNIARY 1. The basic property of a ﬂuid is that it can ﬂow. The ﬂuid does not have any resistance to change of its shape. Thus, the shape of a ﬂuid is governed by the shape of its container. 2. A liquid is incompressible and has a free surface of its own. A gas is compressible and it expands to occupy all the space available to it. 3. If F is the normal force exerted by a ﬂuid on an area A then the average pressure Pav is defined as the ratio of the force to area P..=— A 4. The unit of the pressure is the pascal (Pa). It is the same as N m’z. Other common units of pressure are 1 atm = 1.01X105 Pa 1 bar = 105 Pa 1 torr = 133 Pa = 0.133 kPa 1 mm ong = 1 torr = 133 Pa 5. Pascal’s law states that: Pressure in a ﬂuid at rest is same at all points which are at the same height. A change in pressure applied to an enclosed ﬂuid is transmitted undiminished to every point of the ﬂuid and the walls of the containing vessel. 6. The pressure in a ﬂuid varies with depth h according to the expression P=Pa+pgh where p is the density of the ﬂuid, assumed uniform. 7. The volume of an incompressible ﬂuid passing any point every second in a pipe of non uniform crossection is the same in the steady ﬂow. 1) A = constant ( v is the velocity and A is the area of crossection) The equation is due to mass conservation in incompressible ﬂuid ﬂow. 2019-20"
physics/,"Atomic Hypothesis in Ancient India and Greece Though John Dalton is credited with the introduction of atomic viewpoint in modern science, scholars in ancient India and Greece conjectured long before the existence of atoms and molecules. In the Vaiseshika school of thought in India founded by Kailada [Sixth century BC.) the atomic picture was developed in considerable detail. Atoms were thought to be eternal. indivisible, inﬁnitesimal and ultimate parts of matter. It was argued that if matter could be subdivided without an end. there would be no difference between a mustard seed and the Meru mountain. The four kinds of atoms [Paramanu — Sanskrit word for the smallest particle) postulated were Bhoomi [Eaith). Ap (water). Tejas (ﬁre) and Vayu (air) that have characteristic mass and other attributes, were propounded. Akasa (space) was thought to have no atomic structure and was continuous and inert. Atoms combine to form different molecules [e.g. two atoms combine to form a diatomic molecule dvyanuka. three atoms form a tryanuka or a triatomic molecule). their properties depending upon the nature and ratio of the constituent atoms. The size of the atoms was also estimated. by conjecture or by methods that are not known to us. The estimates vary. In Lalitavistara. a famous biography of the Buddha written mainly in the second century B.C., the estimate is close to the modern estimate of atomic size. of the order of lO’lom. In ancient Greece. Democritus [Fourth century B.C.) is best known for his atomic hypothesis. The word ‘atom' means ‘indivisible' in Greek. According to him. atoms differ from each other physically. in shape. size and other properties and this resulted in the different properties of the substances formed by their combination. The atoms of water were smooth and round and unable to ‘hook’ on to each other. which is why liquid / water ﬂows easily. The atoms of earth were rough and jagged. so they held together to form hard substances. The atoms of fire were thorny which is why it caused painful burns. These fascinating ideas. despite their ingenuity, could not evolve much further. perhaps because they were intuitive conjectures and speculations not tested and modified by quantitative experiments A the hallmark of modern science."
physics/,"MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS 237 — Robert Hooke (1635 - 1703 A.D.) Robert Hooke was born on July 18. 1635 in Freshwater. Isle of Wight. He was one of the most brilliant and versatile seventeenth century English scientists. He attended Oxford University but never graduated. Yet he was an extremely talented inventor. instrument—maker and building designer. He assisted Robert Boyle in the construction of Boylean air pump. In 1662. he was appointed as Curator of Experiments to the newly founded Royal Society. In 1665. he became Professor of Geometry in Gresham College where he carried out his astronomi— cal observations. He built a Gregorian reﬂecting telescope: discovered the fifth star in the trapezium and an asterism in the constellation Orion: suggested that Jupiter rotates on its axis; plotted detailed sketches of Mars which were later used in the 19111 century to determine the planet’s rate of rotation: stated the inverse square law to describe planetary motion, which Newton modified later etc. He was elected Fellow of Royal Society and also served as the Society's Secretary from 1667 to 1682. In his series of observations presented in Micrographia. he suggested wave theory of light and first used the word ‘cell‘ in a biological context as a result of his studies of cork. Robert Hooke is best known to physicists for his discovery of law of elasticity: Ut tensio, sic vis [This is a Latin expression and it means as the distortion. so the force). This law laid the basis for studies of stress and strain and for understanding the elastic materials. As a result of applied tangential force, there is a relative displacement Ax between opposite faces of the cylinder as shown in the Fig. 9.2(b). The strain so produced is known as shearing strain and it is defined as the ratio of relative displacement of the faces Ax to the length of the cylinder L. Ax Shearing strain = T = tan 0 (9.3) where 0 is the angular displacement of the cylinder from the vertical (original position of the cylinder). Usually 0 is very small, tan 0 is nearly equal to angle 0, (if 0 = 10°, for example, there is only 1% difference between 6 and tan 9). k—h—>l (a) (b) It can also be visualised, when a book is pressed with the hand and pushed horizontally, as shown in Fig. 9.2 (c). Thus, shearing strain = tan (9 z 0 (9.4) In Fig. 9.2 (d), a solid sphere placed in the ﬂuid under high pressure is compressed uniformly on all sides. The force applied by the ﬂuid acts in perpendicular direction at each point of the surface and the body is said to be under hydraulic compression. This leads to decrease in its volume without any change of its geometrical shape. The body develops internal restoring forces that are equal and opposite to the forces applied by the ﬂuid (the body restores its original shape and size when taken out from the ﬂuid).

biology/,"ANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS narrow cavities (lumen). These are commonly found in the fruit walls of nuts; pulp of fruits like guava, pear and sapota; seed coats of legumes and leaves of tea. Sclerenchyma provides mechanical support to organs. 6.1 .2.2 Complex Tissues The complex tissues are made of more than one type of cells and these work together as a unit. Xylem and phloem constitute the complex tissues in plants (Figure 6.3). Xylem functions as a conducting tissue for water and minerals from roots to the stem and leaves. It also provides mechanical strength to the plant parts. It is composed of four different kinds of elements, namely, tracheids, vessels, xylem ﬁbres and xylem parenchyma. Gymnosperms lack vessels in their xylem. Tracheids are elongated or tube like cells with thick and ligniﬁed walls and tapering ends. These are dead and are without protoplasm. The inner layers of the cell walls have thickenings which vary in form. In ﬂowering plants, tracheids and vessels are the main water transporting elements. Vessel is a long cylindrical tube-like structure made up of many cells called vessel members, each with ligniﬁed walls and a large central cavity. The vessel cells are also devoid of protoplasm. Vessel members are interconnected through perforations in their common walls. The presence of vessels is a characteristic feature of angiosperms. Xylem ﬁbres have highly thickened walls and obliterated central lumens. These may either be septate or aseptate. Xylem parenchyma cells are living and thin-walled, and their cell walls are made up of cellulose. They store food materials in the form of starch or fat, and other substances like tannins. The radial conduction of water takes place by the ray parenchymatous cells. Primary xylem is of two types — protoxylem and metaxylem. The ﬁrst formed primary xylem elements are called protoxylem and the later formed primary xylem is called metaxylem. In stems, the protoxylem lies towards the centre (pith) and the metaxylem lies towards the periphery of the organ. This type of primary xylem is called endarch. In roots, the protoxylem lies towards periphery and metaxylem lies towards the centre. Such arrangement of primary xylem is called exarch. Phloem transports food materials, usually from leaves to other parts of the plant. Phloem in angiosperms is composed of sieve tube elements, companion cells, phloem parenchyma Tracheid Vessels Sieve pore Sieve tube element Phloem parenchyma Companion cell (b) Figure 6.3 (a) Xylem (b) Phloem"

physics/,"SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTA’I‘IONAL MOTION Z X Fig. 7.18 17 = 1' x F, ris perpendicular to the plane containing r and F, and its direction is given by the right handed screw rule. If a force acts on a single particle at a point P whose position with respect to the origin 0 is given by the position vector 1' (Fig. 7 . 18), the moment of the force acting on the particle with respect to the origin 0 is defined as the vector product 1: = r x F (7.23) The moment of force (or torque) is a vector quantity. The symbol 1: stands for the Greek letter tau. The magnitude of 1: is 1': rFsin0 (7.24a) where r is the magnitude of the position vector r, i.e. the length OP, Fis the magnitude of force F and 0 is the angle between 1' and F as shown. Moment of force has dimensions M LZT'Z. Its dimensions are the same as those of work or energy. It is, however, a very different physical quantity than work. Moment of a force is a vector, while work is a scalar. The SI unit of moment of force is newton metre (N m). The magnitude of the moment of force may be written 1 = (r sin 0)F = riF (7.24b) or 2': rFsin6= rFi (7.240) where ri = r sine is the perpendicular distance of the line of action of F from the origin and FJ: Fsin 6) is the component of F in the direction perpendicular to 1'. Note that 1' = 0 if r= O, F= O or 0 = Ooor 1800 . Thus, the moment of a force vanishes if either the magnitude of the force is zero, or if the line of action of the force passes through the origin. One may note that since rXF is a vector product, properties of a vector product of two vectors apply to it. If the direction of F is reversed, the direction of the moment of force is reversed. If directions of both r and F are reversed, the direction of the moment of force remains the same. 7.7.2 Angular momentum of a particle Just as the moment of a force is the rotational analogue of force in linear motion, the quantity angular momentum is the rotational analogue of linear momentum. We shall first define angular momentum for the special case of a single particle and look at its usefulness in the context of single particle motion. We shall then extend the deﬁnition of angular momentum to systems of particles including rigid bodies. Like moment of a force, angular momentum is also a vector product. It could also be referred to as moment of (linear) momentum. From this term one could guess how angular momentum is defined. Consider a particle of mass m and linear momentum p at a position 1' relative to the origin 0. The angular momentum] of the particle with respect to the origin 0 is defined to be 1 = r x p (7 .25a) The magnitude of the angular momentum vector is l=rpsin6 (7.26a) where p is the magnitude of p and 0 is the angle between 1' and p. We may write l=rpl or rip (7.26b) where rl (= r sine) is the perpendicular distance of the directional line of p from the origin and p i (= p sin 6) is the component of p in a direction perpendicular to r. We expect the angular momentum to be zero (1 = 0), if the linear momentum vanishes (p = 0), if the particle is at the origin (r = O), or if the directional line of p passes through the origin 6 = O0 or 180°. 2019-20"

Terrestrial plants take up huge amount water daily but most of it is lost to the air through evaporation from the leaves, i.e., transpiration. A mature corn plant absorbs almost three litres of water in a day, while a mustard plant absorbs water equal to its own weight in about 5 hours. Because of this high demand for water, it is not surprising that water is often the limiting factor for plant growth and productivity in both agricultural and natural environments. 1 1 .2. 1 Water Potential To comprehend plant-water relations, an understanding of certain standard terms is necessary. Water potential (WW) is a concept fundamental to understanding water movement. Solute potential 01’s) and pressure potential (WP) are the two main components that determine water potential. Water molecules possess kinetic energy. In liquid and gaseous form they are in random motion that is both rapid and constant. The greater the concentration of water in a system, the greater is its kinetic energy or ‘water potential’. Hence, it is obvious that pure water will have the greatest water potential. If two systems containing water are in contact, random movement of water molecules will result in net movement of water molecules from the system with higher energy to the one with lower energy. Thus water will move from the system containing water at higher water potential to the one having low water potential This process of movement of substances down a gradient of free energy is called diffusion. Water potential is denoted by the Greek symbol Psi or ‘l‘ and is expressed in pressure units such as pascals (Pa). By convention, the water potential of pure water at standard temperatures, which is not under any pressure, is taken to be zero. If some solute is dissolved in pure water, the solution has fewer free water molecules and the concentration (free energy) of water decreases, reducing its water potential. Hence, all solutions have a lower water potential than pure water; the magnitude of this lowering due to dissolution of a solute is called solute potential or ‘PS. ‘1; is always negative. The more the solute molecules, the lower (more negative) is the ‘PS . For a solution at atmospheric pressure (water potential) ‘Pw = (solute potential) ‘PS. If a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure is applied to pure water or a solution, its water potential increases. It is equivalent to pumping water from one place to another.

biology/,"ANIMAL KINGDOM Heart is two-chambered (one auricle and one ventricle). Some of them have electric organs (e. g., Torpedo) and some possess poison sting (e.g., Trygon). They are cold-blooded (poikilothermous) animals, i.e., they lack the capacity to regulate their body temperature. Sexes are separate. In males pelvic ﬁns bear claspers. They have internal fertilisation and many of them are viviparous. Examples: Scoliodon (Dog ﬁsh), Pristis (Saw ﬁsh), Carcharodon (Great white shark), Trygon (Sting ray). 4.2.11.3 Class - Osteichthyes It includes both marine and fresh water ﬁshes with bony endoskeleton. Their body is streamlined. Mouth is mostly terminal (Figure 4.20). They have four pairs of gills which are covered by an operculum on each side. Skin is covered with cycloid / ctenoid scales. Air bladder is present which regulates buoyancy. Heart is two- chambered (one auricle and one ventricle). They are cold-blooded animals. Sexes are separate. Fertilisation is usually external. They are mostly oviparous and development is direct. Examples: Marine — Exocoetus (Flying fish), H ippocampus (Sea horse); Freshwater — Labeo (Rohu), Catla (Katla), Clarias (Magur); Aquarium — Betta (Fighting ﬁsh), Pterophyllum (Angel ﬁsh). 4.2.1 1.4 Class - Amphibia As the name indicates (Gr., Amphi : dual, bios, life), amphibians can live in aquatic as well as terrestrial habitats (Figure 4.2 1). Most of them have two pairs of limbs. Body is divisible into head and trunk. Tail may be present in some. The amphibian skin is moist (without scales). The eyes have eyelids. A tympanum represents the ear. Alimentary canal, urinary and reproductive tracts open into a common chamber called cloaca which opens to the exterior. Respiration is by gills, lungs and through skin. The heart is three- chambered (two auricles and one ventricle). These are cold-blooded animals. Sexes are separate. Fertilisation is external. They are oviparous and development is indirect. Examples: Bufo (Toad), Rana (Frog), Hyla (Tree frog), Salamandra (Salamander), Ichthyophis (Limbless amphibia). 201 9-2020 57 (a) (b) Figure 4.20 Examples of Bony fishes : (a) Hippocampus (b) Catla (b) Figure 4.21 Examples of Amphibia : (a) Salamandra (b) Rana"
physics/,"244 PHYSICS 9.6.5 POISSON'S RATIO Careful observations with the Young’s modulus experiment (explained in section 9.6.2), show that there is also a slight reduction in the cross- section (or in the diameter) of the wire. The strain perpendicular to the applied force is called lateral strain. Simon Poisson pointed out that within the elastic limit, lateral strain is directly proportional to the longitudinal strain. The ratio of the lateral strain to the longitudinal strain in a stretched wire is called Poisson’s ratio. If the original diameter of the wire is d and the contraction of the diameter under stress is Ad, the lateral strain is Ad/d. If the original length of the wire is L and the elongation under stress is AL, the longitudinal strain is AL/ L. Poisson’s ratio is then (Ad/ d) / (AL/ L) or (Ad/AL) X (L/d). Poisson’s ratio is a ratio of two strains; it is a pure number and has no dimensions or units. Its value depends only on the nature of material. For steels the value is between 0.28 and 0.30, and for aluminium alloys it is about 0.33. 9.6.6 Elastic Potential Energy in a Stretched Wire When a wire is put under a tensile stress, work is done against the inter-atomic forces. This work is stored in the wire in the form of elastic potential energy. When a wire of original length L and area of cross-section A is subjected to a deforming force F along the length of the wire, let the length of the wire be elongated by I. Then from Eq. (9.8), we have F= YA X (l/L). Here Yis the Young’s modulus of the material of the wire. Now for a further elongation of infinitesimal small length dl, work done dWis F X dl or YAldl/ L. Therefore, the amount of work done (W) in increasing the length of the wire from L to L + l, thatis from l=0 to l= lis lYAl YA 12 = —dl=— _ W Io L 2 XL lex££T ><AL W‘ 2 L X Young’s modulus X strain2 X _l '2 volume of the wire 2019-20 1 = 5X stress X strain X volume of the wire This work is stored in the wire in the form of elastic potential energy (U). Therefore the elastic potential energy per unit volume of the wire (u) is 1 u= —><0'8 (9.15) 2 9.7 APPLICATIONS OF ELASTIC BEHAVIOUR OF MATERIALS The elastic behaviour of materials plays an important role in everyday life. All engineering designs require precise knowledge of the elastic behaviour of materials. For example while designing a building, the structural design of the columns, beams and supports require knowledge of strength of materials used. Have you ever thought why the beams used in construction of bridges, as supports etc. have a cross-section of the type 1? Why does a heap of sand or a hill have a pyramidal shape? Answers to these questions can be obtained from the study of structural engineering which is based on concepts developed here. Cranes used for lifting and moving heavy loads from one place to another have a thick metal rope to which the load is attached. The rope is pulled up using pulleys and motors. Suppose we want to make a crane, which has a lifting capacity of 10 tonnes or metric tons (1 metric ton = 1000 kg). How thick should the steel rope be? We obviously want that the load does not deform the rope permanently. Therefore, the extension should not exceed the elastic limit. From Table 9.1, we find that mild steel has a yield strength (0y) of about 300 x 106 N m‘2. Thus, the area of cross-section (A) of the rope should at least be A2 W/oy = Mg/oy (9.16) = (104 kgx 9.8 m s‘2)/(300 x 106 N m'2) = 3.3 x 10‘4 m2 corresponding to a radius of about 1 cm for a rope of circular cross-section. Generally a large margin of safety (of about a factor of ten in the load) is provided. Thus a thicker rope of radius about 3 cm is recommended. A single wire of this radius would practically be a rigid rod. So the ropes are always made of a number of thin wires braided together,"

The magnitude of this force works out to be as stated above. Newton's Principia Kepler had formulated his third law by 1619. The announcement of the underlying universal law of gravitation came about seventy years later with the publication in 1687 of Newton‘s masterpiece Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematics, often simply called the Principia. Around 1685, Edmund Halley [after whom the famous Halley's comet is named). came to visit Newton at Cambridge and asked him about the nature of the trajectory of a body moving under the inﬂuence of an inverse square law. Without hesitation Newton replied that it had to be an ellipse. and further that he had worked it out long ago around 1665 when he was forced to retire to his farm house from Cambridge on account of a plague outbreak. Unfortunately. Newton had lost his papers. Halley prevailed upon Newton to produce his work in book form and agreed to bear the cost of publication. Newton accomplished this feat in eighteen months of superhuman effort. The Principia is a singular scientiﬁc masterpiece and in the words of Lagrange it is “the greatest production of the human mind.“ The Indian born astrophysicist and Nobel laureate S. Chandrasekhar spent ten years writing a treatise on the Principia. His book. Newton's Principia for the Common Reader brings into sharp focus the beauty. clarity and breath taking economy of Newton‘s methods. 2019-20"
biology/,"G.N. Ramachandran (1922 — 200 l) G.N. RAMACHANDRAN, an outstanding figure in the field of protein structure, was the founder of the ‘Madras school’ of conformational analysis of biopolymers. His discovery of the triple helical structure of collagen published in Nature in 1954 and his analysis of the allowed conformations of proteins through the use of the ‘Ramachandran plot’ rank among the most outstanding contributions in structural biology. He was born on October 8, 1922, in a small town, not far from Cochin on the southwestern coast of India. His father was a professor of mathematics at a local college and thus had considerable inﬂuence in shaping Ramachandran’s interest in mathematics. After completing his school years, Ramachandran graduated in 1942 as the top- ranking student in the B.Sc. (Honors) Physics course of the University of Madras. He received a Ph.D. from Cambridge University in 1949. While at Cambridge, Ramachandran met Linus Pauling and was deeply inﬂuenced by his publications on models of the oc-helix and B-sheet structures that directed his attention to solving the structure of collagen. He passed away at the age of 78, on April 7, 2001. 2019-2020"
