<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
<p id="d0e93">I want here to express my thanks and appreciation to Mr. Lessing J. Rosenwald, through whose kindness this unique Doctrina
was presented to the Library of Congress and with whom the idea of this publication originated. His interest and enthusiasm
made possible my work, and his friendly advice and encouragement have been both valuable and heart-warming.

</p>
<p id="d0e95">I also wish to thank others who have given me great assistance. They are Dr. A.S.W. Rosenbach to whom I continually turned
for advice, Dr. Lawrence C. Wroth of the John Carter Brown Library and Dr. Leslie W. Dunlap of the Library of Congress who
very kindly read over my manuscript and gave me the benefit of their suggestions and criticisms, Mr. David C. Mearns and Miss
Elsie Rackstraw of the Library of Congress and Mrs. Ruth Lapham Butler of the Ayer Collection of the Newberry Library who
so freely and generously made available to me the great collections of works on the Philippines in their libraries, Dr. John
H. Powell of the Free Library of Philadelphia who helped me find reference books of the utmost importance, and the many librarians
who courteously answered written queries about early Philippine material. <span class="smallcaps">Edwin Wolf 2nd.</span>

<h1>Doctrina Christiana</h1>
<p id="d0e105">The first book printed in the Philippines has been the object of a hunt which has extended from Manila to Berlin, and from
Italy to Chile, for four hundred and fifty years. The patient research of scholars, the scraps of evidence found in books
and archives, the amazingly accurate hypotheses of bibliographers who have sifted the material so painstakingly gathered together,
combine to make its history a bookish detective story par excellence.

</p>
<p id="d0e107">It is easy when a prisoner has been arrested and brought to the dock to give details of his complexion, height, characteristics
and identifying marks, to fingerprint him and to photograph him, but how inadequate was the description before his capture,
how frequently did false scents draw the pursuer off the right track! It is with this in mind that we examine the subject
of this investigation, remembering that it has not been done before in detail. And, to complete the case, the book has been
photographed in its entirety and its facsimile herewith published.

</p>
<p id="d0e109">In studying the Doctrina Christiana of 1593 there are four general problems which we shall discuss. First, we shall give a
physical description of the book. Secondly, we shall trace chronologically the bibliographical history of the Doctrina, that
is, we shall record the available evidence which shows that it was the first book printed in the Philippines, and weigh the
testimonies which state or imply to the contrary. Thirdly, we shall try to establish the authorship of the text, and lastly,
we shall discuss the actual printing.

</p>
<p id="d0e111">It hardly needs be told why so few of the incunabula of the Philippines have survived. The paper on which they were printed
was one of <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e113"></a>
[2]
</span>the most destructible papers ever used in book production. The native worms and insects thrived on it, and the heat and dampness
took their slower but equally certain toll. Add to these enemies the acts of providence of which the Philippines have received
more than their share&#8212;earthquake, fire and flood&#8212;and the man-made devastations of war, combined with the fact that there was
no systematic attempt made in the Philippines to preserve in archives and libraries the records of the past, and it can well
be understood why a scant handful of cradle-books have been preserved. The two fires of 1603 alone, which burned the Dominican
convent in Manila to the ground and consumed the whole of Binondo just outside the walls, must have played untold havoc upon
the records of the early missionaries. Perhaps the only copies of early Philippine books which exist today, unchronided and
forgotten, are those which were sent to Europe in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, and may now be lying uncatalogued in
some library there.

</p>
<p id="d0e115">One copy of this Doctrina was sent to Philip&nbsp;II by the Governor of the Philippines in 1593; and in 1785 a Jesuit philologist,
Hervas y Panduro, printed Tagalog texts from a then extant copy. Yet, since that time no example is recorded as having been
seen by bibliographer or historian. The provenance of the present one is but imperfectly known. In the spring of 1946 William
H. Schab, a New York dealer, was in Paris, and heard through a friend of the existence of a 1593 Manila book. He expressed
such incredulity at this information that his friend, feeling his integrity impugned, telephoned the owner then and there,
and confirmed the unbelievable &#8220;1593.&#8221; Delighted and enthused, Schab arranged to meet him, found that he was a Paris bookseller
and collector who specialized in Pacific imprints and was fully aware of the importance of the volume, and induced him to
sell the precious Doctrina. He brought it back with him to the United States and offered it to Lessing J. Rosenwald, who promptly
purchased it and presented it to the Library of Congress. Where <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e117"></a>
[3]
</span>the book had been before it reached Paris we do not know. Perhaps it is the very copy sent to Philip&nbsp;II, perhaps the copy
from which Hervas got his text. Indeed, it may have been churned to the surface by the late Civil War in Spain, and sent from
there to France. In the course of years from similar sources may come other books to throw more light upon the only too poorly
documented history of the establishment of printing in the Philippine Islands.


</p>
<p class="div2"><a id="d0e119"></a></p>
<h2>The Physical Description</h2>
<p id="d0e122">Let us first examine the book as it appears before us. The title-page reads:

</p>
<p id="d0e124"></p>
<div id="d0e125" class="divFigure">
<p class="legend"><img border="0" src="images/title.gif" alt=""></p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e127">The book, printed in Gothic letters and Tagalog<a id="d0e129src" href="#d0e129" class="noteref">1</a> characters on paper made from the paper mulberry, now browned and brittle with age, consists of thirty-eight leaves, comprising
a title-page as above, under a woodcut<a id="d0e138src" href="#d0e138" class="noteref">2</a> of St. Dominic, with the verso originally blank, but in this copy bearing the contemporary manuscript inscription, <i>Tassada en dos rreales</i>, signed <i>Juan de Cuellar</i>; and seventy-four pages of text in Spanish, Tagalog transliterated into roman letters, and Tagalog in Tagalog characters.
The size of the volume, which is unbound, is 9&#8539; by 7 inches, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e147"></a>
[4]
</span>although individual leaves vary somewhat due to chipping. Some of the leaves have become separated from their complements,
but enough remain in the original stitching to indicate that the book was originally made up in four gatherings, the first
of twelve leaves, the second of ten, the third of ten, and the fourth of six. Although the book is of the size called quarto,
the method of printing must have been page by page, so it is doubtful that each sheet was folded twice in the usual quarto
manner, but more probable that it was printed four pages to a sheet of paper approximately 9&#8539; by 14 inches, which was folded
once.

</p>
<p id="d0e149">The volume is printed throughout by the xylographic method, that is to say, each page of text is printed from one wood-block
which was carved by hand. Along the inner margins of some pages are vertical lines which were made by the inked edge of the
block, and the grain of the wood has caused striations to appear in the printed portions throughout. The unevenness of the
impression indicates that the pages were printed in some primitive manner without the help of a conventional press.

</p>
<p id="d0e151">The paper, which is one of the distinctive features of most old Oriental books, has been discussed at length by Pardo de Tavera
in his study of early Philippine printing, and we can do no better than translate the relevant passage in full:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e154">&#8220;I have said before that the material composition of our books is inferior. The imprints before 1830 were made on a paper
called by some rice paper, by others silk paper, and by still others China paper, according to their taste. It is detestable,
brittle, without consistency or resistance, and was called rice paper because it was supposed to be made from that grain.
It was the only kind then used in the Philippines, not only for printing, but for all manner of writing, letters, etc., and
it is even recorded that in 1874 when tobacco was a state monopoly, cigarettes were made with this paper, and that the Indians
and Chinese preferred it (and perhaps they still do) to rag paper or other kinds, because of the horrible taste it gives the
tobacco.


</p>
<p id="d0e156">&#8220;In China they commonly made paper of bamboo, but more principally from cotton and a plant which travellers have cited only
by its common name, which they transcribe in various ways, calling it <i>kochu</i>, <i>kotsu</i>, or <i>kotzu</i>. Today it is known that this plant is an ulmacea (<i>Broussonetia papyrifera</i>) from a mash of which they <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e170"></a>
[5]
</span>still make cloth in Japan. Cotton paper is superior to it, and naturally more expensive; but the paper of inferior quality
which was received in Manila, where nothing was imported regularly but common articles of low price, was of <i>kotsu.</i> As all Chinese-made paper it was coated with alum, the finer [the paper] the thicker [the coating], for the purpose of whitening
it and making the surface smooth, a deplorable business, for it made the paper very moisture absorbent, a condition fatal
in such a humid climate as in these islands. Moreover, as the alum used is impure and contains a large proportion of iron
salts, the humidity and weather oxidize it which finally darkens the paper, so that Philippine books present a coloration
which runs the gamut of tones from the color of bone to that of dark cinnamon.&#8221;<a id="d0e175src" href="#d0e175" class="noteref">3</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e187">Because the Doctrina Christiana, which may well be translated &#8220;The Teachings of Christianity,&#8221; contains the basic elements
of the religion which the missionaries were trying to spread among the unbaptized in the remote regions of the world, it was
the most useful handbook they had. A summary of the contents of the present edition shows the fundamental character of the
work. After a syllabary comes the Pater Noster, the primary and most popular prayer of Christianity. Then follow the Ave Maria,
Credo, Salve Regina, Articles of Faith, Ten Commandments, Commandments of the Holy Church, Sacraments of the Holy Church,
Seven Mortal Sins, Fourteen Works of Charity, Confession and Catechism. Here in a small compass is presented the simplest,
most easily learned and most essential tenets of the Catholic Church.

</p>
<p id="d0e189">So useful was the Doctrina considered as a guide for those who had just been, or were about to be, converted that the missionary
fathers placed it in most cases foremost among the books necessary to have in print in a strange land. It is generally accepted
today, although no extant copy is known, that the first book printed in Mexico<a id="d0e191src" href="#d0e191" class="noteref">4</a> in 1539 was a Doctrina in Mexican and Spanish. Recent research has shown that the second book printed by the pioneer Jesuit
press at Goa, in India, in 1557 was St. Francis Xavier&#8217;s <i>Doutrina Christ&atilde;o</i><a id="d0e202src" href="#d0e202" class="noteref">5</a> in the Malay language, of which also no copy has yet been located. But there are copies of the first book to come from a
South American press, another Doctrina<a id="d0e208src" href="#d0e208" class="noteref">6</a> printed in <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e214"></a>
[6]
</span>the native and Spanish languages at Lima in 1584. So the choice of this book as the first to be printed at Manila follows
a widespread precedent.

</p>
<p id="d0e216">We have then a book, the Doctrina Christiana, in Spanish and Tagalog, corrected by priests of more than one order&#8212;and this
is important in tracing the authorship of the work&#8212;and printed by the xylographic method with license at Manila at the Dominican
Church of San Gabriel in 1593. So much we get from the title, and in itself it is a fairly complete story, but from the date
of its issue until the present time that very fundamental information has not been completely recorded.



</p>
<p class="div2"><a id="d0e218"></a></p>
<h2>The Bibliographical History</h2>
<p id="d0e221">In tracing our clues down through the years, we find at the very beginning the most valuable evidence which has been uncovered,
short of the book itself. From Manila on June 20, 1593, the Governor of the Philippines, Gomez Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as, wrote a letter
to Philip&nbsp;II of Spain in which he said:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e224">&#8220;Sire, in the name of Your Majesty, I have for this once, because of the existing great need, granted a license for the printing
of the Doctrinas Christianas, herewith enclosed&#8212;one in the Tagalog language, which is the native and best of these islands,
and the other in Chinese&#8212;from which I hope great benefits will result in the conversion and instruction of the peoples of
both nations; and because the lands of the Indies are on a larger scale in everything and things more expensive, I have set
the price of them at four reales a piece, until Your Majesty is pleased to decree in full what is to be done.&#8221;<a id="d0e226src" href="#d0e226" class="noteref">7</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e235">This states unequivocally that two books were printed at Manila some time before June 20, 1593, one of which was the Doctrina
in Tagalog, and the other the same work in Chinese. Although we are chiefly concerned here with the former, the fact that
they were produced at about the same time and probably at the same place makes it necessary to trace the history of both in
order to reconstruct the circumstances surrounding <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e237"></a>
[7]
</span>the production of the one. Of the Chinese Doctrina no copy has yet come to light, and except for two 1593 references, there
are no records of its existence.

</p>
<p id="d0e239">Another document<a id="d0e241src" href="#d0e241" class="noteref">8</a> of 1593 verifies the information given in the letter of Dasmari&ntilde;as, differing from it only in one detail. In the Archives
of the Indies was found a manuscript account of 1593 listing books written in the Philippines, which says:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e256">&#8220;There have been printed primers and catechisms of the faith, one in Spanish and Tagalog, which is the native language, and
the other in Chinese, which are being sent to Your Majesty, the Tagalog priced at two reales and the Chinese at four, which
is hoped will be of great benefit.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e259">The accounts of the printing of two Doctrinas contained in these documents confirm some of the information of the title and
add a bit more. First, the letter says that the book was printed by permission given by the Governor, which agrees with the
&#8220;with license&#8221; of the title, &#8220;for this once because of the existing great need.&#8221; By a royal cedula<a id="d0e261src" href="#d0e261" class="noteref">9</a> of September 21, 1556, which was promulgated again on August 14, 1560, it had been ordered that Justices &#8220;not consent to
or permit to be printed or sold any book containing material concerning the Indies without having special license sent by
our Royal Council of the Indies,&#8221; and on May 8, 1584 this was implemented by the further order &#8220;that when any grammar or dictionary
of the language of the Indies be made it shall not be published, or printed or used unless it has first been examined by the
Bishop and seen by the Royal Audiencia.&#8221; This latter portion was applied specifically to the Philippines in a letter<a id="d0e266src" href="#d0e266" class="noteref">10</a> from Philip&nbsp;II to the Audiencia of Manila, also dated May 8, 1584, to which further reference will be made. It can be gathered
from Dasmari&ntilde;as&#8217; implied apology that he had never before given such a license, and, since he had arrived in the Philippines
in 1590, that no books had been printed between that time and the licensing of the Doctrinas. It is, moreover, likely that
if any similar books had been <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e272"></a>
[8]
</span>printed during the administrations of his predecessors he would have mentioned the fact as a precedent for acting contrary
to the cedulas.

</p>
<p id="d0e274">According to Dasmari&ntilde;as he had priced the books at four reales a piece, which followed the regular Spanish procedure, under
which books were subject to price control. The Governor, it will be noted, also apologized for the high price he was forced
to set, giving general high prices<a id="d0e276src" href="#d0e276" class="noteref">11</a> as his excuse. Yet, while the appraisal of four reales for this book was high compared to the prevailing scale in Spain,
it was not high compared to prices allowed in Mexico. On June 6, 1542 the Emperor had given the Casa de Cromberger, the first
printing-house in Mexico, permission<a id="d0e282src" href="#d0e282" class="noteref">12</a> to sell books printed there at seventeen maraved&iacute;s a sheet, or exactly one half a real. If we assume that, although the Doctrina
had been printed page by page, it was quarto in size and so appraised on the basis of eight pages to a sheet, we find that
the price per sheet comes to about fourteen maraved&iacute;s, or less than half a real. However, a contradiction occurs between the
letter of Dasmari&ntilde;as and this copy of the Doctrina, supported by the other 1593 document. On the verso of the title, Juan
de Cuellar,<a id="d0e297src" href="#d0e297" class="noteref">13</a> the Governor&#8217;s secretary and the logical person to sign the official valuation, gives the price as two reales, and the 1593
account, while agreeing with the letter as far as the Chinese Doctrina is concerned, also lists the price of the Tagalog Doctrina
as two reales. It is impossible to say what caused the discrepancy; perhaps it was a decision on Dasmari&ntilde;as&#8217; part to lower
the cost, notwithstanding inflationary values, in order to make the book more readily available for the natives who were not
economically as well off as the Chinese, or it could be that after the letter had been written it was noticed that the Chinese
volume was larger than the Tagalog one, and some adjustment made. In any event, the price of this Doctrina was finally set
at two reales, making it less than half the price allowed in Mexico fifty years before.

</p>
<p id="d0e306">The evidence of the two 1593 documents would seem conclusive <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e308"></a>
[9]
</span>with regard to printing in 1593, but witnesses were not long in appearing who stated something quite different. The earliest
of these was Pedro Chirino,<a id="d0e310src" href="#d0e310" class="noteref">14</a> a Jesuit priest, who came to the Philippines with Dasmari&ntilde;as in 1590. He went back to Europe in 1602, and while there had
a history of the Philippines printed at Rome in 1604. In 1606 he returned to the islands, where he died in 1635. He left unpublished
the manuscript of another and more detailed history, dated 1610, which contains a most significant passage, where, after speaking
of various early writers in native languages, he continues:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e314">&#8220;Those who printed first were; P. Fr. Juan de Villanueva of the Order of St. Augustine [who printed] certain little tracts,
and P. Fr. Francisco de San Joseph of the Order of St. Dominic [who printed] larger things of more bulk.&#8221;<a id="d0e316src" href="#d0e316" class="noteref">15</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e322">Concerning this Juan de Villanueva<a id="d0e324src" href="#d0e324" class="noteref">16</a> very little indeed is known. From what has been recorded it would seem that there were two Augustinians of the same name
who were in the Philippines before 1600. The first of these was a secular priest who came to Ceb&uacute; about 1566, may have taken
the Augustinian habit some time after his arrival, and died not long after 1569. The other Juan de Villanueva, the date of
whose arrival is unknown, was in Lubao in 1590, in Hagonoy in 1593, and prior of Batangas from 1596 until his death in 1599.
Of the two there can be no doubt but that Chirino referred to the second one. But, apart from Chirino&#8217;s note, there is no
record anywhere that works by him existed, nor do the Augustinian chroniclers themselves, except for the modern Santiago Vela
who knew of Chirino&#8217;s citation, mention him as a linguist or a writer. The only possibility is that between 1593 and 1599
Villanueva had printed some small xylographic books no copies and no further record of which have appeared.

</p>
<p id="d0e330">As for Francisco de San Joseph, or Blancas de San Jos&eacute; as he is more frequently called, there are other references to his
part in the establishment of printing in the islands. From information doubtless obtained from <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e332"></a>
[10]
</span>Diego Aduarte, then in Spain, Alonso Fernandez wrote in his ecclesiastical history, printed at Toledo in 1611:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e335">&#8220;Father Fr. Francisco Blancas printed in the Tagalog language and characters a book of Our Lady of the Rosary in the year
1602, which was the first book that was printed there of that or any other material. After this he printed another of the
sacraments in the language of the Philippines, in both characters, theirs and ours, from which the greatest results have been
achieved.&#8221;<a id="d0e337src" href="#d0e337" class="noteref">17</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e355">Two years later the same author published at Madrid an account<a id="d0e357src" href="#d0e357" class="noteref">18</a> of the miracles performed by the Rosary of the Virgin, in which he included a list of &#8220;Of some writers of the Order of St.
Dominic who were living in this year 1612,&#8221; and gave the same information as above, adding only that the printing took place
in Bataan.

</p>
<p id="d0e369">Diego Aduarte,<a id="d0e371src" href="#d0e371" class="noteref">19</a> whose history of the Dominican province of the Philippines is one of the best contemporary ones written, bears out these
statements of which he was most probably the source. Aduarte came to the islands in company with his close friend Blancas
de San Jos&eacute; in 1595, went back to Spain as procurator of his order in 1607, and returned to Manila in 1628, staying in the
Orient until his death in 1636. His history was continued and edited after his death by a fellow Dominican, Domingo Gon&ccedil;alez,
who had it printed in 1640. Summarizing the life and accomplishments of Blancas de San Jos&eacute;, Aduarte wrote:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e378">&#8220;So he was sent to Bataan, which is near there [Manila], where he learned the language of the Indians, called Tagalog, which
is the most common in this country and is used among the Indians for many leagues around the city. So rapid was his study
of the language that he began to preach in it within three months, and could teach it to others in six.... And believing that
he was the instrument needed to bring the holy gospel to the Indians, he spared no pains to investigate the fitness of their
words, the way to use them, and all the rest so that he could succeed in mastering it.... He wrote many books of devotion
for them, and since there was no printing in these islands, and no one who understood it or who was a journeyman printer,
he planned to have it done through a Chinaman, a good Christian, who, seeing that the books of P. Fr. Francisco were sure
to be of great use, bestowed so much care upon this undertaking that he finally succeeded, aided by those who told him whatever
they knew about it, in learning everything necessary to do printing; and he printed <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e380"></a>
[11]
</span>these books. . . . He [Blancas de San Jos&eacute;] printed a grammar to learn the Tagalog language, a memorial of the Christian life,
a book on the four last things, another on the preparation for the communion, a confessionary, another on the mysteries of
the Rosary of Our Lady, and another to teach the Tagalog Indians the Spanish language, and he left many very pious and curious
works in the language of these Indians.&#8221;<a id="d0e382src" href="#d0e382" class="noteref">20</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e385">Blancas de San Jos&eacute;,<a id="d0e387src" href="#d0e387" class="noteref">21</a> as we have noted, came to the Philippines in 1595. He was at Abucay in Bataan from 1598 until 1602, and then spent several
years in and about Manila, preaching to the Indians and the Chinese, whose language he also mastered. In 1614 he set out for
Spain, but died on the voyage before reaching Mexico. Of the books which he is said to have had printed, only two are known
to be extant, the <i>Arte y Reglas de la Lengva Tagala</i><a id="d0e398src" href="#d0e398" class="noteref">22</a> and the <i>Librong Pagaaralan nang manga Tagalog nang uicang Castilla</i><a id="d0e406src" href="#d0e406" class="noteref">23</a> (or <i>Libro en qve aprendan los Tagalos, la lengua Castellana</i>), both printed at Bataan in 1610, and until the discovery of the present Doctrina and the <i>Ordinationes</i> of 1604 the earliest surviving Philippine imprints known.

</p>
<p id="d0e415">We have not cited here in detail the account of Juan Lopez<a id="d0e417src" href="#d0e417" class="noteref">24</a> in the fifth part of his history of the Dominicans, because, although it was printed nineteen years before the appearance
of Aduarte&#8217;s work, the information therein contained regarding the Philippines was acknowledgedly obtained from the unfinished
manuscript which Aduarte had with him in Spain. The pertinent passages add nothing to Aduarte&#8217;s information, and even the
wording is reminiscent of his.

</p>
<p id="d0e423">The first suggestion that early Philippine books may have been printed from wood-blocks occurred in Qu&eacute;tif and Echard&#8217;s bibliography
of Dominican writers printed at Paris in 1719. There, after listing eight works by Blancas de San Jos&eacute;, they add:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e426">&#8220;He published all these in the Philippines with the help of a Chinese Christian using Chinese blocks, for in his day European
typographers had not yet arrived in those islands, nor did they have types for their language.&#8221;<a id="d0e428src" href="#d0e428" class="noteref">25</a></p>
</div><p>

<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e440"></a>
[12]
</span></p>
<p id="d0e441">This was an amazing suggestion, for as far as we know the bibliographers who made it had not actually seen the books; nor
is it entirely true. The first two works listed are two books we know were printed typographically in 1610. The sixth is <i>De los mysterios del Rosario de nuestra Se&ntilde;ora Tagalice</i>, the book referred to by Fern&aacute;ndez as having been printed in 1602, and generally accepted as being from movable type, although
no copy has been discovered to prove it. And yet, it is not at all impossible that some time before 1602 Blancas de San Jos&eacute;
had some of his writings printed from blocks. In any event, the idea, later developed by Medina and Retana, that xylography
was used before a real printing-press was established, may have come from this not wholly accurate note.

</p>
<p id="d0e446">For almost a hundred and fifty years no historian or bibliographer wrote anything to challenge the basic affirmations of Chirino,
Fern&aacute;ndez and Aduarte. In the middle of the 18th century, Lorenzo Hervas y Panduro,<a id="d0e448src" href="#d0e448" class="noteref">26</a> a Jesuit, was forced by the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain to seek refuge in the Papal States, and took up residence
at Cesena. There he began work on a tremendous universal history of the spiritual development of man, into which he wove the
results of his philosophical, social and linguistic studies. These last were of particular importance, and Hervas is regarded
as the true founder of the science of linguistics and comparative philology. In 1785 he published the eighteenth volume of
his massive work, the <i>Origine, formazione, meccanismo, ed armonia degl&#8217; idiomi</i>, in which he printed a Tagalog Ave Maria as written in 1593, with the note:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e455">&#8220;The Ave Maria in the Tagalog of 1593 is to be read in the Tagalog-Spanish Doctrina Christiana which was printed in Tagalog
and roman characters by the Dominican fathers in their printing-house at Manila in the year 1593.&#8221;<a id="d0e457src" href="#d0e457" class="noteref">27</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e463">In 1787 he finished his twenty-first volume, <i>Saggio pratico</i>,<a id="d0e468src" href="#d0e468" class="noteref">28</a> which was another philological study, including the Pater Noster in over three hundred languages and dialects, among them
Tagalog, again from the 1593 Doctrina. Here, then, is ample proof that a copy of this book was known <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e474"></a>
[13]
</span>to Hervas in 1785, and the only information which his loose transcription of the title failed to give was that the volume
was &#8220;corrected by members of the orders,&#8221; that it was printed with license, and that it was printed at San Gabriel.

</p>
<p id="d0e476">At the beginning of the following century two German scholars, familiar with Hervas&#8217; writings, noted the 1593 Doctrina. Franz
Carl Alter,<a id="d0e478src" href="#d0e478" class="noteref">29</a> in his monograph on the Tagalog language, printed the Ave Maria from the text which had appeared in 1785, and Johann Christoph
Adelung,<a id="d0e484src" href="#d0e484" class="noteref">30</a> in his <i>Mithridates</i>, a comprehensive study of languages, included the Tagalog Pater Noster from the <i>Saggio pratico</i> of 1787. The latter also listed in a short bibliography of the Tagalog language the Doctrina of 1593, giving exactly the
same information about it that Hervas had. Neither of these men apparently saw a copy of the book, limiting themselves to
extracts from Hervas, but they perpetuated an earlier reference of the utmost importance.

</p>
<p id="d0e496">Shortly after the two Germans published their notices of the 1593 Doctrina an entry appeared of a book printed at Manila in
1581. Jos&eacute; Mariano Beristain y Sousa, a learned Mexican writer, issued in 1819&#8211;21 a bibliography of Spanish-American books,
in which he listed alphabetically the authors, giving a short biography of each and adding a list of his works. Under Juan
de Qui&ntilde;ones we find:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e499">&#8220;&#8216;Arte y Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala,&#8217; Imp. en Manila, 1581.&#8221;<a id="d0e501src" href="#d0e501" class="noteref">31</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e507">No specific authority is given for this entry, but in his sketch of the life of Qui&ntilde;ones Beristain cited as sources, Juan
de Grijalva, Nicol&aacute;s Antonio, Gaspar de San Agustin, and Jos&eacute; Sicardo. It would seem logical that one of these must have mentioned
such a work as printed in Manila in 1581, but in tracing down the sources no such precise notice is found.

</p>
<p id="d0e509">Grijalva simply said that Qui&ntilde;ones &#8220;concerned himself with Tagalog and made a vocabulary and grammar of it.&#8221;<a id="d0e511src" href="#d0e511" class="noteref">32</a> Antonio<a id="d0e517src" href="#d0e517" class="noteref">33</a> referred to <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e523"></a>
[14]
</span>Grijalva, and carried the matter no further. San Agustin, describing the Franciscan chapter of 1578, wrote:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e526">&#8220;It was determined moreover in this chapter that P. Fr. Juan de Qui&ntilde;ones, prior of the Convent of Taal in Tagalos, and Fr.
Diego de Ochoa, prior of Bacolor in Pampanga, should compose and fashion grammars, dictionaries, and confessionaries in the
two languages [respectively Tagalog and Pampanga] in which they had ventured; which they executed very promptly and well,
and these were of great use to those who came to these islands, for they had these by which they could study the languages.&#8221;<a id="d0e528src" href="#d0e528" class="noteref">34</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e531">Later, San Agustin, again mentioning Qui&ntilde;ones, referred to Grijalva, and added as an additional source for his information
T&oacute;mas de Herrera. Sicardo<a id="d0e533src" href="#d0e533" class="noteref">35</a> added nothing new. Herrera, not cited directly by Beristain, may however have been the source from which the &#8220;Imp.&#8221; of his
entry came. Herrera wrote:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e543">&#8220;He [Qui&ntilde;ones] was the first to have learned the Tagalog language of which he published a grammar and dictionary as an aid
to the ministers of the gospel.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e546">If Beristain read this, he may have been misled by the Latin of &#8220;published,&#8221;<a id="d0e548src" href="#d0e548" class="noteref">36</a> <i>in lucem edidit</i>, which may indeed mean printed and published, but also means quite properly published in the sense of written in manuscript
and copied and circulated. We agree with Schilling<a id="d0e557src" href="#d0e557" class="noteref">37</a> that this latter meaning was the one intended. One other statement that Qui&ntilde;ones&#8217; works were printed may derive from the
same misunderstanding. About the year 1801 Pedro Bello wrote an account, still in manuscript and unpublished, of the writings
of the Augustinians. His remarks on Qui&ntilde;ones, first printed by Santiago Vela<a id="d0e560src" href="#d0e560" class="noteref">38</a>, we believe are only an extension of Herrera&#8217;s <i>in lucem edidit</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e569">This same confusion in terminology has been used<a id="d0e571src" href="#d0e571" class="noteref">39</a> to support Beristain&#8217;s claim by introducing as evidence the letter of Philip&nbsp;II of May 8, 1584. Salazar, the Bishop of Manila,
probably shortly after the Synod of 1582, had written the King a letter, now unfortunately lost, in which <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e574"></a>
[15]
</span>he spoke of a decision to standardize linguistic works. In answer to the Bishop, the following letter in the form of a royal
cedula was sent:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e577">&#8220;To the President and Judges of my Royal Audiencia situated in the city of Manila in the Philippine Islands.&#8212;It has been told
me on behalf of Don Fray Domingo de Salazar, Bishop of that place, that it was agreed that no priest might make a grammar
or vocabulary, and that if it were made it might not be published before being examined and approved by the said Bishop, because
otherwise there would result great differences and disagreements in the doctrine; and this having been seen by my Council
of the Indies, it was agreed that I should order this my cedula which decrees that when any grammar or vocabulary be made
it shall not be published or used unless it has first been examined by the said Bishop and seen by this Audencia.&#8221;<a id="d0e579src" href="#d0e579" class="noteref">40</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e594">Here again the word <i>publicado</i> is brought forth to prove that the letter referred to printed works, but here again the term is equally applicable to manuscript
works in common use and generally available.

</p>
<p id="d0e599">Further evidence that there was no printing as early as 1581 is to be found in a letter<a id="d0e601src" href="#d0e601" class="noteref">41</a> from Juan de Plasencia, a Tagalist of great renown, to the King, dated from Manila, June 18, 1585, in which he reported on
the state of missionary work in China and Japan, and added that he had written a grammar and a declaration of the whole Doctrina
in the most common language of the Philippines, and that he was then making a dictionary, concluding by asking the King to
send decrees ordering those works to be printed in Mexico at the expense of the Exchequer. Is it likely that Plasencia would
have so written if an <i>Arte y Vocabulario</i> had been printed four years earlier? Furthermore, San Antonio, recording the book on the customs and rites of the Indians
written by Plasencia at the request of the Governor Santiago de Vera, and dated October 24, 1589, said that it was not printed
&#8220;because printing houses had not yet come to this country.&#8221;<a id="d0e607src" href="#d0e607" class="noteref">42</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e610">We then conclude with regard to Beristain&#8217;s entry, that although there existed in manuscript an <i>Arte y Vocabuldrio Tagalo</i> by Juan de Qui&ntilde;ones, there is no evidence of the existence of any book printed for <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e615"></a>
[16]
</span>him from wood-blocks or in type. Santiago de Vela<a id="d0e617src" href="#d0e617" class="noteref">43</a> suggests the possibility that there might have been a xylographic <i>Arte</i> of 1581, but Schilling<a id="d0e626src" href="#d0e626" class="noteref">44</a> questions this in the face of the complete lack of reference to such a printed work by any 17th or 18th century writer, and
the tenuous notices of Bello and Beristain; yet to say categorically that no such work was printed would be foolhardy in the
face of the scanty early records and the appearance of this Doctrina, a single copy of which has just been discovered.

</p>
<p id="d0e629">The first important work devoted solely to the early history of the Philippine press was by T.H. Pardo de Tavera, who in 1893
published his study of printing and engraving in the Philippines. He there recorded a 1593 Doctrina, but adamantly refused
to accept it on the hearsay evidence of others. His account is valuable because it shows that there may have been a copy of
the Doctrina in Java in 1885, and so we quote from it at some length:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e632">&#8220;A learned Dutch orientalist, Dr. J. Brandes, wrote me in 1885 from Bali-Boeleleng (Java) telling me that in 1593 at Manila
there was printed a Doctrina Christiana in Spanish-Tagalog, with the proper characters for the latter language. Other orientalists,
at the last Congress in London in 1891, gave me the same information. Nonetheless, no one told me where he had read such a
thing, nor much less that he had managed to see such a book, although inspecting a rare book which I acquired in Paris (Alter,
<i>Ueber die tagalische sprache</i>, Vienna, 1803), I saw that the author cited such a Doctrina Christiana and said that he knew of its existence through Abb&eacute;
Hervas. This is an error, and without doubt such a Doctrina was in manuscript, because in 1591 [he should have said 1593]
there was no press in Manila nor in any part of the archipelago, and today we know for certain and positively that the first
book issued there appeared in 1610.&#8221;<a id="d0e637src" href="#d0e637" class="noteref">45</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e643">Pardo de Tavera was the first to call attention to Alter, and through him to Hervas, and in all probability the orientalists
at the London Congress had seen the Doctrina cited by one of these or Adelung. But he rejects that evidence in no uncertain
terms. Mitigating somewhat his assurance, he speaks following the above-quoted passage of printing in China, and <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e645"></a>
[17]
</span>differentiates between xylographic and typographic printing, and since he was obviously thinking in terms of printing on a
press with movable type his conclusions are not too extreme.

</p>
<p id="d0e647">In 1896 appeared Jos&eacute; Toribio Medina&#8217;s <i>La Imprenta en Manila</i>, which was up to then the best, most complete and most scholarly work on early Philippine printing, and is today with its
subsequent additions and corrections the standard bibliography of the subject. There Medina cited most of the authorities
we have already quoted, the letter of Dasmari&ntilde;as, Fern&aacute;ndez&#8217; <i>Historia eclesiastica</i>, Aduarte, Adelung, Beristain and Pardo de Tavera. Then, basing his conclusions strongly on the Dasmari&ntilde;as letter and the
note of Adelung, he listed<a id="d0e655src" href="#d0e655" class="noteref">46</a> as number one in his bibliography the Doctrina of 1593 in Spanish and Tagalog, and as number two the Doctrina in Spanish
and Chinese of the same year. This is a verdict which has stood the test of time, and one that is just now confirmed by the
discovery of the book itself. Two points, however, in his survey should be noted. In his discussion of the printing and the
authorship Medina does not emphasize the Dominican origin of the book, although he does say that &#8220;it does not appear bold
to us to suppose that the imprint of these Doctrinas ought to be the Hospital of San Gabriel in this village [Binondo],&#8221;<a id="d0e658src" href="#d0e658" class="noteref">47</a> and faithfully copies Adelung&#8217;s imprint notice, &#8220;in the Dominican printing-house,&#8221; in his listing of the book. The other
point is that he says in his introduction and repeats in his entry that the Doctrina had a Latin as well as Spanish and Tagalog
texts, an erroneous translation of Adelung&#8217;s &#8220;mit lateinische und tagalische Schrift.&#8221; He was hesitant as are all bibliographers,
who must perforce record the probable existence of a book a copy of which they have never seen, in committing himself as to
whether it was printed from blocks or from type or by a combination of the two methods.

</p>
<p id="d0e661">More positive and more succinct than Medina was T.E. Retana whose earlier researches<a id="d0e663src" href="#d0e663" class="noteref">48</a> into the history of the Philippines Medina <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e675"></a>
[18]
</span>acknowledgedly made use of, and who in 1897 published his <i>La Imprenta en Filipinas, Adiciones y Observaciones a La Imprenta en Manila</i>. He took the material of Medina, added the evidence of Chirino and Plasencia, and resummarized the problem. The letter of
Dasmari&ntilde;as showed conclusively that a Doctrina was printed in 1593. Chirino said that the first two whose works were printed
were Juan de Villanueva and Blancas de San Jos&eacute;. Fern&aacute;ndez stated positively that the first book printed in the Philippines
was the book of Our Lady of the Rosary by Blancas de San Jos&eacute; printed at Bataan in 1602. Aduarte supported this without mentioning
a title, place or date of printing. If we are to accept all these statements as incontrovertible, how can the apparent contradictions
be reconciled? The answer had already been hinted at, but Retana solved the problem with amazing acumen, and arrived at four
conclusions, which are here printed in his own words:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e681">&#8220;A&#8212;That the Doctrinas of 1593, though printed at Manila, were not executed in type, but by the so-called xylographic method;


</p>
<p id="d0e683">B&#8212;That the initiative for the establishment of <i>typography</i> is owed to P. Fr. Francisco Blancas de San Jos&eacute;;


</p>
<p id="d0e688">C&#8212;That the first <i>typographer</i> was the Chinese Christian Juan de Vera at the instigation of the said Father San Jos&eacute;;


</p>
<p id="d0e693">D&#8212;That the first <i>typographical</i> printing of this Dominican author is of the year 1602.&#8221;<a id="d0e698src" href="#d0e698" class="noteref">49</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e701">It is not difficult to say with the book itself in front of us, that it is an example of xylographic printing, but it was
a great feat on the part of Retana, who had never seen a copy, to resolve apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion
on the part of several unquestioned authorities by deducing that it was all a matter of semantics&#8212;what did <i>printing</i> mean? As for the sprite of 1581 introduced by Beristain, Retana dismissed it on the grounds of insufficient evidence. In
a word, he concluded that the first book issued in the Philippines was a Doctrina printed from wood-blocks in 1593.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e706"></a>
[19]
</span></p>
<p id="d0e707">All subsequent writers on the subject have derived their information from the sources we have already mentioned, and to a
great degree have been influenced by the findings of Medina and Retana. The Rev. Thomas Cooke Middleton<a id="d0e709src" href="#d0e709" class="noteref">50</a> in 1900 confessed that he did not know what the first book printed was. Pardo de Tavera maintained his old intransigence, when in the introduction to his bibliography for the Library of Congress in 1903 he wrote that Medina&#8217;s affirmation that
printing took place in 1593 &#8220;loses all validity in the face of the categorical statement of F. Alonso Fern&aacute;ndez.&#8221;<a id="d0e718src" href="#d0e718" class="noteref">51</a> Medina did not comment further in his <i>Adiciones y Ampliaciones</i><a id="d0e726src" href="#d0e726" class="noteref">52</a> of 1904, yet when the same year P&eacute;rez and G&uuml;emes<a id="d0e732src" href="#d0e732" class="noteref">53</a> published their additions to and continuation of Medina, bringing his bibliography down to 1850, they resurrected the 1581
<i>Arte</i>, but added no new evidence to prove their case. Blair and Robertson, in their tremendous, collective history of the Philippines,
did not include a list of Philippine imprints in their bibliography,<a id="d0e738src" href="#d0e738" class="noteref">54</a> but referred readers to Medina and Retana with whom they agreed. To celebrate the three hundredth anniversary of typographical
printing in the Philippines Artigas y Cuerva<a id="d0e741src" href="#d0e741" class="noteref">55</a> wrote a study which emphasized the part played by Blancas de San Jos&eacute;, but did not deny the existence of the 1593 Doctrina.
Retana<a id="d0e747src" href="#d0e747" class="noteref">56</a> in 1911 brought his work on the subject up to date, but retained all his major conclusions. In Palau&#8217;s standard bibliography
of Spanish books we find the Doctrinas called &#8220;the two earliest books known to have been printed in Manila.&#8221;<a id="d0e756src" href="#d0e756" class="noteref">57</a> Finally, the most thorough recent work on the subject is to be found in Schilling&#8217;s<a id="d0e762src" href="#d0e762" class="noteref">58</a> survey of the early history of the Philippine press published in 1937. There is little that can be added to the evidence
uncovered by these modern writers, but the appearance of the book itself enables us to say with certainty some things which
they were able only to surmise. However, as regards the authorship and the circumstances and place of printing we are able,
from the information given on the title, to carry the investigation somewhat further.

<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e767"></a>
[20]
</span></p>
<p class="div2"><a id="d0e768"></a></p>
<h2>The Authorship of the Text</h2>
<p id="d0e771">The title tells us that the book was &#8220;corrected&#8221; by the priests of more than one order, and since it was printed by the Dominicans,
we can assume that the ultimate responsibility for the preparation of the text in consultation with friars of other orders
also lay in their hands. Our problem then is to discover what texts were available to them in 1593 and who were the priests
who formed the editorial board. We have included in this study also the origins of the Chinese text, for the two Doctrinas
appeared at the same time, and as we shall see the same Dominicans were probably responsible for the production and preparation
of both the Tagalog and the Chinese texts. During the period under discussion there were priests of four orders active in
the islands, and so we shall speak in turn of the Augustinian, Franciscan, Jesuit and Dominican fathers who might have written
or worked on the Doctrinas printed in 1593.


</p>
<p class="div2"><a id="d0e773"></a></p>
<h2>The Augustinians</h2>
<p id="d0e776">The first priests to come to the Philippines were six Augustinians who accompanied Legazpi on the expedition which in 1565
established the first permanent European settlement in the islands. Among them was Martin de Rada, who was one of the most
important and influential priests during the early days of the Spanish colony, and who was the first linguist of note to work
in the Philippines. The first language he learned was Visayan,<a id="d0e778src" href="#d0e778" class="noteref">59</a> native to the island of Ceb&uacute; where the Spaniards first landed, but he also learned Chinese. In May 1572 he was elected provincial
of his order, and in June 1575 he went with Jer&oacute;nimo Mar&iacute;n, as ambassador to China, being &#8220;the first Spaniard who entered
into that said kingdom.&#8221;<a id="d0e784src" href="#d0e784" class="noteref">60</a> In preparation for the voyage, we are told by Gonz&aacute;lez de Mendoza, whose famous and popular history of China first printed
in 1585 derives in a great measure from information brought back by Rada, that Rada <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e787"></a>
[21]
</span>&#8220;began with great care &amp; studie to learne that language [Chinese], the which he learned in few daies: &amp; did make thereof a
dictionarie.&#8221;<a id="d0e789src" href="#d0e789" class="noteref">61</a> Rada was then not only the first to write in Visayan, but also the first to compile a Chinese dictionary, and more important
still brought back with him to Manila from China many books of which Mendoza gives a list.<a id="d0e798src" href="#d0e798" class="noteref">62</a> These books, printed in the usual Chinese method from wood-blocks, could have provided models for the Spaniards in the Philippines
who lacked European facilities for printing, and they may have given birth to the idea which resulted in the xylographic Doctrinas.


</p>
<p id="d0e804">Within the first few years several more Augustinian fathers<a id="d0e806src" href="#d0e806" class="noteref">63</a> arrived whose linguistic accomplishments are briefly noted by the historians, but while these men were certainly pioneers
in the speaking of Tagalog and Chinese, they are not recorded as having written in the language. According to Cano,<a id="d0e809src" href="#d0e809" class="noteref">64</a> the first Tagalog grammar was written by Agustin de Alburquerque, and Retana<a id="d0e812src" href="#d0e812" class="noteref">65</a> considered him one of the possible authors of the present Doctrina. This friar reached the Philippines in 1571, accompanied
Rada on his second expedition to China in 1576, was elected provincial in 1578, and died in 1580. However, there is no early
record saying that Alburquerque wrote any linguistic work. The statement was not made until the 19th century, and in contradiction
Juan de Medina, who wrote in 1630, said that Juan de Qui&ntilde;ones &#8220;made a grammar and lexicon of the Tagal language, which was
the first to make a start in the rules of its mode of speech.&#8221;<a id="d0e815src" href="#d0e815" class="noteref">66</a> Furthermore, in the official acts<a id="d0e818src" href="#d0e818" class="noteref">67</a> of the Augustinian province we find that on August 20, 1578 Alburquerque as provincial of the order commissioned Qui&ntilde;ones
to write a grammar, dictionary and confessionary in the Tagalog language. The conclusions of Santiago de Vela<a id="d0e824src" href="#d0e824" class="noteref">68</a> are that it is doubtful that Alburquerque wrote any linguistic works, and if he did they were liable to have been rough preliminary
studies<a id="d0e827src" href="#d0e827" class="noteref">69</a> upon which the texts of Qui&ntilde;ones were based. In view of the lack of positive contemporary evidence<a id="d0e836src" href="#d0e836" class="noteref">70</a> we believe that Alburquerque <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e845"></a>
[22]
</span>may be eliminated except as the instigator of such works, and we return again to Juan de Qui&ntilde;ones.

</p>
<p id="d0e847">In so far as Qui&ntilde;ones<a id="d0e849src" href="#d0e849" class="noteref">71</a> was the author of a grammar and dictionary claimed to have been printed at Manila in 1581, we have shown what various writers
have said, and though we must conclude that the work was probably not printed, it is certain that he wrote in the Tagalog
language. Agustin Maria de Castro<a id="d0e852src" href="#d0e852" class="noteref">72</a> said, although no earlier writers support it, that Qui&ntilde;ones actually presented a grammar, dictionary and Doctrina in Tagalog
at the Synod of 1582 for its approval. Our total information about this Augustinian linguist boils down to these essentials:
that he did write a grammar and dictionary of Tagalog about 1578&#8211;81, which may have been the earliest written in the Philippines;
that he may have presented these and a Doctrina at the Synod of 1582 which approved Juan de Plasencia&#8217;s works; that there
is no concrete evidence that any of these works were printed; and that Qui&ntilde;ones&#8217; works which were extant in manuscript in
1593 might have been consulted in the preparation of the present Doctrina.

</p>
<p id="d0e855">Another member of the Order of St. Augustine who might have been able to participate in the editing of the 1593 Doctrinas
was Diego Mu&ntilde;oz. Mu&ntilde;oz came to the islands in 1578, and died in 1594. Of him San Agustin writes:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e858">&#8220;Moreover in this year [1581] the ministry for the Sangleys was founded in the convent of Tondo, and P. Fr. Diego Mu&ntilde;oz was
named as its special minister. He devoted particular zeal to the study of the Chinese language, and preached in it with much
elegance. And all the Sangleys who were going to be baptized, and there were many, had recourse to this ministry, and the
teaching was continued with much vigilance and care. And there never lacked a religious of our order to apply himself to such
holy work, from the time we came to this land, as our original records of the province prove.&#8221;<a id="d0e860src" href="#d0e860" class="noteref">73</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e863">To him is also attributed<a id="d0e865src" href="#d0e865" class="noteref">74</a> a volume of manuscript panegyric sermons in Tagalog, and because of this and his work at Tondo he may <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e868"></a>
[23]
</span>have been consulted by the Dominicans. We also mention Lorenzo de Le&oacute;n,<a id="d0e870src" href="#d0e870" class="noteref">75</a> who arrived in 1582, spent twelve years in the provinces, wrote a book called the <i>Estrella del mar</i> in Tagalog, and died in 1623, and might also have helped.



</p>
<p class="div2"><a id="d0e876"></a></p>
<h2>The Franciscans</h2>
<p id="d0e879">Although the first Franciscans did not arrive in the Philippines until June 24, 1577, the writings of the linguists of that
order are more fully recorded. Among the earliest was Juan de Plasencia who, the Franciscans claim, wrote the first Tagalog
grammar. He was fortunate in meeting soon after his arrival Miguel de Talavera,<a id="d0e881src" href="#d0e881" class="noteref">76</a> who had come with his parents on the expedition of Legazpi. Miguel, then quite young, became in a manner of speaking the
disciple of Plasencia, and while the father taught him Latin, he in turn taught Plasencia the elements of Tagalog which he
had picked up. For two years Plasencia ministered in the provinces of Tayabas, Laguna, and Bulacan where he used and perfected
his knowledge of the native language. On May 20, 1579, when the provincial Pedro de Alfaro left for China, he named Plasencia
acting provincial during his absence. A reference to the earliest linguistic writings of the Franciscans occurs in an account
by Santa In&eacute;s of the chapter meeting held in the Convent of Los Angeles in July 1580, which was presided over by Plasencia:



</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e888">&#8220;The third and last thing that was determined in this chapter was that a grammar and dictionary of the Tagalog language should
be made and a translation of the Doctrina Christiana completed. And since Fr. Juan de Plasencia, the president of this same
chapter, excelled all in the language, he was given this responsibility, and he accepted it, and immediately set to work.
And then after great study, much lack of sleep and care, together with fervent prayers and other spiritual duties, of not
little importance in the good profit of such work, he reduced the language to a grammar, made a catechism, a very full dictionary,
and various translations.&#8221;<a id="d0e890src" href="#d0e890" class="noteref">77</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e893">But the most important record of his writings is contained in the description of the Synod called by Bishop Salazar in 1582.
In March, 1581, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e895"></a>
[24]
</span>Domingo de Salazar, the first Bishop of Manila and the Philippines, had arrived. The problems which faced him were manifold,
particularly those of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, the treatment of the natives by government administrators, and the means
by which the gospel could best be spread. A synod was called to resolve these points. One matter of the utmost importance
was the approval of standard Tagalog texts, and Juan de la Concepcion gives the following account of what transpired in this
connection:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e898">&#8220;His excellency presided at the meetings. At them the most learned topics were discussed and the most learned persons were
present&#8212;the Dominican father Salvatierra, the most outstanding scholars among the Augustinians and Franciscans, the Jesuit
fathers Sede&ntilde;o and Sanchez, and the Licentiate Don Diego Vasquez de Mercado as dean of the new cathedral. At this convention
or diocesan synod it was discussed whether the Indians were to be ministered to in their native language, or if they would
be obliged to learn Spanish, and it was decided to instruct them in their native tongue. The divine office, the Doctrina Christiana,
which Father Fr. Juan de Plasencia had translated into the Tagalog language, was approved. His work, the <i>Arte y Vocabuldrio Tagalo</i>, was judged most useful because of the ease by which it permitted an understanding and thorough knowledge of so foreign a
language.&#8221;<a id="d0e903src" href="#d0e903" class="noteref">78</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e921">The already quoted account of Santa In&eacute;s continues with a similar description of the Synod, and says that when the problem
of teaching the natives was brought up only Plasencia could resolve it.


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e924">&#8220;Since, having seen his catechism and the translation which he had made in Tagalog of the grammar and dictionary, those who
were at the Synod and understood anything of the language could do nothing but admire the fitness of the terms, their efficacy
and strength. And they said that, without the particular help of heaven, it seemed impossible that in so short a time and
with so few years in the country he could have done such excellent work. And then, having approved them, they ordered that
various copies be made, particularly of the translation of the Doctrina, so that with them and with no other would the ministers
teach the Indians, and so it was approved, in order that there might be uniformity in all parts of the Tagalog country. This
translation is that which has come down to this day, except that it is more polished.&#8221;<a id="d0e926src" href="#d0e926" class="noteref">79</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e935">It must have been shortly after the handbooks of Plasencia received the seal of ecclesiastical approval that Salazar wrote
the King speaking of the <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e937"></a>
[25]
</span>action taken, and got back in answer the cedula, quoted before, giving the Bishop and Audiencia the right of censorship over
such works. The question of chronological precedence<a id="d0e939src" href="#d0e939" class="noteref">80</a> between Qui&ntilde;ones and Plasencia is not important, for the specific approval of Plasencia&#8217;s texts by the Synod, attended by
Qui&ntilde;ones himself, shows that Plasencia&#8217;s books were accepted, and in conformity with the ruling of the Synod would have been
the only texts allowed to be used generally in the Philippines.

</p>
<p id="d0e945">Another reference to writers in the native tongues in an anonymous manuscript of 1649 introduces the names of other linguists:



</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e948">&#8220;The first missionaries left many writings in the Tagalog and Bicol languages, the best of which are those left by Fathers
Fray Juan de Oliver, Fray Juan de Plasencia, Fray Miguel de Talavera, Fray Diego de la Asuncion, and Fray Ger&oacute;nimo Monte.
Mention is here made of the above fathers because they were the first masters of the Tagalog language, and since their writings
are so common and so well received by all the orders. They have not been printed, because they are voluminous, and there are
no arrangements in this kingdom for printing so much.&#8221;<a id="d0e950src" href="#d0e950" class="noteref">81</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e958">Miguel de Talavera we have spoken of before. That he helped Plasencia in the compilation of his earliest works in Tagalog
is clear, and to him in part must be attributed the miracle of the production by Plasencia of the texts &#8220;in so short a time
and with so few years in the country.&#8221; Mart&iacute;nez says specifically that Talavera &#8220;was the first interpreter among our priests,
and greatly helped Fr. Juan de Plasencia in the composition of the <i>Arte y Vocabulario</i>.&#8221;<a id="d0e963src" href="#d0e963" class="noteref">82</a> Juan de Oliver was in somewhat the same relationship to Plasencia, but instead of helping with the initial attempts, he carried
on from where Plasencia left off. Oliver came to the Philippines on the same expedition which brought Bishop Salazar in 1581.
According to Huerta<a id="d0e966src" href="#d0e966" class="noteref">83</a> he worked in various Tagalog villages, and mastered the Tagalog and Bicol languages, in which he wrote twenty-two works,
which Huerta lists. Of these three are of particular interest to us. The first entry says that he &#8220;corrected the Tagalog grammar
written by Fr. Juan de Plasencia, and added the adverbs and particles;&#8221;<a id="d0e975src" href="#d0e975" class="noteref">84</a> the second that &#8220;he <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e981"></a>
[26]
</span>perfected and augmented the Spanish-Tagalog dictionary, written by the said Fr. Juan de Plasencia;&#8221; and the sixteenth lists
a <i>Catecismo de doctrina Cristiana esplicado</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e986">Several authors, attempting to establish the priority of Qui&ntilde;ones&#8217; dictionary, question the existence of one by Plasencia
at the Synod of 1582 in the face of his own statement in 1585 that he &#8220;was then making a dictionary.&#8221;<a id="d0e988src" href="#d0e988" class="noteref">85</a> To us there seems to be no inconsistency, if Plasencia in 1585 was referring to a revision, unquestionably made with his
knowledge and help, by Juan de Oliver. In short, it is reasonable to assume that Plasencia, burdened with administrative duties
from 1583 to 1586, during which time he was custodian of his order, secured the aid of Oliver in reediting and continuing
his linguistic studies. Plasencia died in 1590.

</p>
<p id="d0e991">The other two Franciscans listed by the anonymous historian of 1649 are elsewhere recorded as having written various works
in Tagalog. To both Diego de la Asuncion<a id="d0e993src" href="#d0e993" class="noteref">86</a> and Ger&oacute;nimo Montes y Escamillo<a id="d0e1002src" href="#d0e1002" class="noteref">87</a> were attributed grammars and dictionaries, and the latter also wrote a <i>Devotional tagalog</i>, said to have been printed at Manila in 1610. In speaking of these early linguistic texts, it is not necessary to believe
that each was a completely original work, but rather that they were based upon a recognized model, which was at first the
Talavera-Plasencia-Oliver text, and that the individual missionaries used their experience in the field to produce, as it
were, new editions. That this was the case is borne out by the notes of Pablo Rojo to his bibliography of Plasencia where
speaking of the grammar and dictionary he says that &#8220;perfected by other missionaries, they have been the base for such grammars
and dictionaries of Tagalog as have been written, but in the form in which they came from the hands of their author, they
have not come down to us.&#8221;<a id="d0e1026src" href="#d0e1026" class="noteref">88</a> More important still is Rojo&#8217;s statement<a id="d0e1038src" href="#d0e1038" class="noteref">89</a> that he found a portion of Plasencia&#8217;s Doctrina which had been believed lost, and from which he quotes the Pater Noster.
Since he does not say where the manuscript was or how it was known to be <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1041"></a>
[27]
</span>Plasencia&#8217;s text, we cannot put too much reliance on the statement, but the text as there printed, while similar to that of
the present Doctrina, is not identical.


</p>
<p class="div2"><a id="d0e1043"></a></p>
<h2>The Jesuits</h2>
<p id="d0e1046">Before passing on to the Dominicans we shall mention briefly the linguists of the Society of Jesus. In the early days there
were not many Jesuits in the Philippines. However, there were some linguists among them, chiefly of the Visayan tongue, in
which they are said to have printed a Doctrina<a id="d0e1048src" href="#d0e1048" class="noteref">90</a> as early as 1610. Limiting ourselves to a note of those who knew Chinese and Tagalog, we find that the first mentioned by
Chirino as an outstanding master of one of these was Francisco Almerique, who arrived with Santiago de Vera in 1583. Shortly
thereafter he &#8220;began the study of the Chinese language in his zeal to aid in the conversion of the many Chinese who came to
Manila and whom we in the Philippines call Sangleys.&#8221;<a id="d0e1051src" href="#d0e1051" class="noteref">91</a> And Colin says &#8220;his principal occupation was with the Tagalog Indians, being the first of the Company to learn their language.&#8221;<a id="d0e1054src" href="#d0e1054" class="noteref">92</a> Nothing further is said of his accomplishments in these languages, but his knowledge would have been available in 1593, for
he was then still active in the islands.

</p>
<p id="d0e1057">Chirino himself landed at Manila in 1590 shortly after Dasmari&ntilde;as, and went almost immediately to Taytay where he learned
Tagalog and was joined in 1592 by Martin Henriquez. At the time Juan de Oliver was preaching in that district, and it is exceedingly
probable that he helped the newcomers with the language, for Chirino speaks of him in terms of highest praise. Henriquez &#8220;learned
the language in three months and in six wrote a catechism in it, a confessionary, and a book of sermons for all the gospels
of the year in the said idiom,&#8221;<a id="d0e1059src" href="#d0e1059" class="noteref">93</a> but he died on February 3, 1593 at Taytay. How thoroughly Chirino himself had grasped the fundamentals of Tagalog is evident
from his three chapters<a id="d0e1062src" href="#d0e1062" class="noteref">94</a> on the language and letters <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1065"></a>
[28]
</span>of the natives in which he prints the Ave Maria in Tagalog and reproduces the Tagalog alphabet&#8212;its first appearance in a European
publication. But Chirino, who remained in the provinces until 1595, would have mentioned his participation and that of Henriquez
in the Doctrina of 1593, so we record them as possible but not probable consultants.


</p>
<p class="div2"><a id="d0e1067"></a></p>
<h2>The Dominicans</h2>
<p id="d0e1070">Had Aduarte written that the first books printed at Manila were two Doctrinas issued by the Dominicans at San Gabriel in 1593,
and given some details of their production, we could conclude our study with a quotation from him, but nowhere does he mention
them. In fact, his inference was that the first book was that printed for Blancas de San Jos&eacute;, and yet we know that this Doctrina
preceded anything that Blancas de San Jos&eacute; could have written, since he did not come to the Philippines until 1595. We can
assume, as Retana did, that by printing Aduarte meant printing from movable type, but this does not explain away the fact
that Aduarte, who recorded in detail events of far less significance, did not speak of the Doctrinas at all. The best&#8212;and
it is a most unsatisfactory best&#8212;that we can do is ascribe the omission to the frailty of man, and record that there is no
notice of the Dominican Doctrina of 1593 in the most complete contemporary Dominican history of the Philippines.

</p>
<p id="d0e1072">The first members of the Order of St. Dominic<a id="d0e1074src" href="#d0e1074" class="noteref">95</a> to land in the Philippines were Bishop Salazar and his assistant, Christoval de Salvatierra. But they were fully occupied
with the administration of the bishopric and could not devote themselves to regular missionary work. It was not until July
25, 1587 that working Dominican missionaries came. Then fifteen<a id="d0e1080src" href="#d0e1080" class="noteref">96</a> under the leadership of Juan de Castro arrived, and established the first Dominican province<a id="d0e1083src" href="#d0e1083" class="noteref">97</a> of the Philippines and China, thus consummating the hope expressed as early as 1579.<a id="d0e1089src" href="#d0e1089" class="noteref">98</a>
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1092"></a>
[29]
</span></p>
<p id="d0e1093">In consultation with the other orders it was decided that the Dominicans should be given the ministry of the territories of
Pangasinan and Bataan, which had theretofore been spiritually exploited by few priests. Almost immediately, on September 15,
1587, the vicariate of Bataan was founded and settled. In speaking of it, Aduarte stressed the importance of a knowledge of
the language of the natives, which there would have been Tagalog, to the success of the mission. Domingo de Nieva, one of
the four members of the mission, learned it rapidly and well, and soon began to preach to the Indians in their own tongue.
His aptitude for languages and its usefulness to the Dominicans must have been very great, for Aduarte in listing the priests
who originally volunteered in Spain makes few comments about individuals, but of Nieva he remarks that he &#8220;was afterwards
of great importance because of the great ease and skill with which he learned languages, whether Indian or Chinese.&#8221;<a id="d0e1095src" href="#d0e1095" class="noteref">99</a> Unfortunately Nieva was only a deacon, and so could not hear confession, a fact which was greatly deplored, because during
that first year no other priest mastered the language sufficiently well to do it, but in September 1588 he reached the requisite
age and was ordained. About that time the friars in Bataan&#8212;one had died and another was ailing&#8212;were joined by Juan de la Cruz,
&#8220;who, being young, succeeded very well with the language,&#8221;<a id="d0e1098src" href="#d0e1098" class="noteref">100</a> and also succeeded in surviving the climate.

</p>
<p id="d0e1101">Early in 1588 Juan Cobo<a id="d0e1103src" href="#d0e1103" class="noteref">101</a> arrived from Mexico. Shortly thereafter, on June 12, 1588, the Dominican chapter held its first convocation. It elected Juan
de Castro the first provincial, adopted the general ordinances<a id="d0e1106src" href="#d0e1106" class="noteref">102</a> already made in Mexico, gave the convent at Manila the title of priory, and designated as parts of the province four vicariates.
Of primary importance was the appointment then of Juan Cobo to the mission for the Chinese.

</p>
<p id="d0e1112">From the very earliest days of the Spanish occupation of Manila, the governors had had trouble with the Chinese and Sangleys.<a id="d0e1114src" href="#d0e1114" class="noteref">103</a> These people <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1126"></a>
[30]
</span>had long conducted a profitable trade between China and the Philippines, and many had settled permanently near Manila, while
others stayed there regularly between trading voyages. The Chinese merchants were in full control of the shops of the city,
and so monopolized retail trade that the early governors legislated<a id="d0e1128src" href="#d0e1128" class="noteref">104</a> against them to give the Spaniards a chance to establish themselves in business. In 1588 there were as many as seven thousand
of them in and around Manila.

</p>
<p id="d0e1131">No one had objected to the Pangasinan and Bataan assignments, but when it was suggested that the Dominicans also assume the
responsibility for the ministry over the Chinese and Sangleys in the suburbs of Manila, the Augustinians vehemently resented
what they considered an invasion of their prior rights. Aduarte omits any account of a disagreement, merely saying that since
the Chinese had had no one to minister to them the Dominicans assumed that responsibility, but in a letter<a id="d0e1133src" href="#d0e1133" class="noteref">105</a> from the Licentiate Gaspar de Ayala to Philip II, dated from Manila, July 15, 1589, full details of the squabble are given.
From this source we learn that the Augustinians had a convent in the village of Tondo in the Chinese district. There they
had ministered to the natives in their own language, but had rather neglected their Chinese-speaking parishioners. Consequently
after the arrival of the Dominicans the Audiencia passed an ordinance requiring that the Bishop appoint ministers of one order
to administer to the Chinese in their own language within thirty days. To meet the deadline the Augustinians began to study
Chinese at breakneck speed, but when the Bishop came to Tondo to hear one of the friars, who was supposed to know the language,
preach in it, there was some trouble as a result of which the Augustinian would not, or indeed could not, preach. Naturally,
when it was decided to award the territory to the Dominicans, the Augustinians accused the Bishop of favoritism towards his
own order.

</p>
<p id="d0e1136">The whole situation is best described in the report on the Chinese made by Salazar to the King on June 24, 1590:


<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1138"></a>
[31]
</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e1140">&#8220;When I arrived in this land, I found that in a village called Tondo&#8212;which is not far from this city, there being a river
between&#8212;lived many Sangleys, of whom some were Christians, but the larger part infidels. In this city were also some shops
kept by Sangleys, who lived here in order to sell the goods which they kept here year by year. These Sangleys were scattered
among the Spaniards, with no specific place assigned to them, until Don Gonzalo Ronquillo allotted them a place to live in,
and to be used as a silk-market (which is here called <i>Pari&aacute;n</i>), of four large buildings. Here, many shops were opened, commerce increased, and more Sangleys came to this city.... When
I came, all the Sangleys were almost forgotten, and relegated to a corner. No thought was taken for their conversion, because
no one knew their language or undertook to learn it on account of its great difficulty; and because the religious who lived
here were too busy with the natives of these islands. Although the Augustinian religious had charge of the Sangleys of Tondo,
they did not minister to or instruct them in their own language, but in that of the natives or this land; thus the Sangley
Christians living here, were Christians only in name, knowing no more of Christianity than if they had never accepted it....
Then I appealed to all religious orders to appoint some one of their religious to learn the language and take charge of the
Sangleys. Although all of them showed a desire to do so, and some even began to learn it, yet no one succeeded; and the Sangleys
found themselves with no one to instruct them and take up their conversion with the necessary earnestness, until, in the year
eighty-seven, God brought to these islands the religious of St. Dominic.&#8221;<a id="d0e1145src" href="#d0e1145" class="noteref">106</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e1151">So we find, as the Dominicans undertook their mission, a large settlement of Chinese, including both a settled and a floating
population, concentrated in the Pari&aacute;n, across the Pasig river from the main city of Manila.

</p>
<p id="d0e1153">The dominating figure of the Chinese mission from the time of his arrival in the Philippines was Juan Cobo. In a letter, written
by him from the Pari&aacute;n of Manila, July 13, 1589, probably to ecclesiastical authorities in Mexico, he gives an account of
the early days of the mission:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e1156">&#8220;The Order took a site next to this Pari&aacute;n, since there was not a single house between Santo Domingo and the Pari&aacute;n. And because
of this opportunity the Order presently charged itself with the Chinese, both Christians and infidels. And upon P. Fr. Miguel
de Benavides and P. Fr. Juan Maldonado was imposed the responsibility for the care of the Chinese and for learning their language.
P. Fr. Miguel was less occupied with other matters than Fr. Juan Maldonado, so that he progressed in the language enough to
begin to catechize in it. This was the first year the Order was in Manila.

<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1158"></a>
[32]
</span></p>
<p id="d0e1159">&#8220;Presently in the second year when I came, the Order moved P. Fr. Miguel and myself into another separate house at the other
edge of the Pari&aacute;n. So that there stood between Santo Domingo and San Gabriel, which is the name of this church of the Chinese,
the whole of the Pari&aacute;n of the Sangleys. And there a poor little church was built under the protection of San Gabriel, to
whom it fell by lot, and a poor house where we two lived. We entered into it at the beginning of September 1588. This was
the first church for the Chinese built, and we believe that there is today not another parish church [for the Chinese] but
that.... And P. Fr. Miguel catechized them and preached to them in their Chinese language, and taught the doctrine in it.
I myself did not yet know the language, but the Lord has been served, so that in a short time I progressed in it.&#8221;<a id="d0e1161src" href="#d0e1161" class="noteref">107</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e1164">The account of Aduarte is not so accurate in some details, but it supplies others not mentioned by Cobo. The first mission
which Benavides and Maldonado (or de San Pedro Martyr as he was later known) built was near the village of Tondo, in a new
settlement specially founded for Christian Chinese, called Baybay, and it was named for Our Lady of the Purification. The
second mission which was established by Benavides and Cobo was at first a palm-leaf hut. The name of San Gabriel was decided
upon by making lots with the names of various saints on them and then drawing. San Gabriel came out three times in a row,
and &#8220;all were persuaded that the Lord was pleased to have the patronage belong to this holy archangel.&#8221; Soon, because of the
good works of the fathers who established a hospital there for the care of the sick and poor, the demands upon the hut became
so great that a larger building was planned. At first it was to have been erected on the site of the hut, but the inhabitants
protested that a stone building so near native houses might do them great damage in the event of an earthquake, so the friars
went to the other side of the river, and there built a temporary building of wood which was later completed in stone. It was
here then that the Doctrina was printed, in the Church of San Gabriel, near the Pari&aacute;n of Manila, at the edge of the Chinese
settlement.

</p>
<p id="d0e1166">Under the care of Benavides and Cobo the mission flourished, and the two fathers became increasingly proficient in the Chinese
language. When <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1168"></a>
[33]
</span>the provincial Juan de Castro began making preparations for an inspection tour of his Chinese vicariate in 1590, he chose
as his companion Miguel de Benavides. The account of the events leading up to this expedition is given in the already quoted
letter of Salazar on the Chinese:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e1171">&#8220;Of the Dominican religious who came to these islands, four are engaged in ministering to the Sangleys. Two of these four
officiate in the Church of San Gabriel, which, together with the house where the religious live, stands close to the Pari&aacute;n.
Another church with its house is on the promontory of Baybay, near Tondo&#8212;which a river divides, separating it from Manila.
Two of the four have learned the language of the Sangleys so well, and one of these two how to write also (which is the most
difficult part of the language), that the Sangleys wonder at their knowledge.... After due consideration of the matter, the
Dominican fathers and myself decided that it was necessary to go to China.... Thus we decided upon the departure, sending
at present no more than two religious: Fray Miguel de Benavides, who was the first to learn the language of the Sangleys;
and Father Juan de Castro, who came as vicar of the religious and who was made provincial here. We preferred these two, as
one is well acquainted with the language, and the other is much loved and esteemed by the Sangleys on account of his venerable
gray locks and blessed old age; and we know that in that land old people are much respected and revered.&#8221;<a id="d0e1173src" href="#d0e1173" class="noteref">108</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e1176">They sailed on May 22, 1590, but Juan de Castro before he left appointed Cobo acting superior of the province with full authority
during his absence, and in the latter&#8217;s place as head of the Chinese mission sent Juan de San Pedro Martyr.

</p>
<p id="d0e1178">There is no doubt but that at this time Benavides and Cobo were the two outstanding Chinese linguists among the Spaniards
in the Philippines. To Benavides has been attributed<a id="d0e1180src" href="#d0e1180" class="noteref">109</a> a Chinese dictionary, and Schilling<a id="d0e1189src" href="#d0e1189" class="noteref">110</a> uses the already quoted letter of Cobo to prove that he also wrote a Doctrina in Chinese, but, granting that such works were
written by him, there is no evidence that they were written in Chinese characters, and not in Chinese transliterated into
roman letters. The available evidence points to the fact that Cobo was the only one who could then write in Chinese characters.
Salazar in his above quoted letter had said that &#8220;one of these two [have learned] how to write also,&#8221; and in the same letter
he continued, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1192"></a>
[34]
</span>&#8220;Fray Juan Cobo, the Dominican religious&#8212;who, as I have said before, knows the language of the Sangleys and their writing,
and who is most esteemed by them&#8212;is sending to Your Majesty a book, one of a number brought to him from China.&#8221;<a id="d0e1194src" href="#d0e1194" class="noteref">111</a> Further witness to Cobo&#8217;s amazing knowledge of Chinese writing is given by Aduarte:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e1198">&#8220;He knew three thousand Chinese characters, each different from all the rest, for the Chinese have no definite number of letters
nor alphabet.... He translated a number [of Chinese books]; for like those of Seneca, though they are the work of heathens,
they contain many profound sayings like ours. He taught astrology to some of them whom he found capable of learning; and to
bring them by all means to their salvation also taught them some trades that are necessary among Spaniards, but which, not
being used by the Chinese, they did not know&#8212;such as painting images, binding books, cutting and sewing clothes, and such
things&#8212;doing all to win men to God.&#8221;<a id="d0e1200src" href="#d0e1200" class="noteref">112</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e1203">Finally, as a more definite proof that Cobo could have been the author of the Chinese Doctrina of 1593, we have the record<a id="d0e1205src" href="#d0e1205" class="noteref">113</a> of a <i>Catecismo de la Doctrina Cristiana en Lengua China</i> written by him, as well as many other works in Chinese.

</p>
<p id="d0e1244">In May 1590, then, the most accomplished Sinologist yet to work in the Philippines was in charge of the Dominican province.
&#8220;His first act,&#8221; wrote Aduarte, &#8220;was to strengthen the ministry to the Chinese by appointing to it Father Domingo de Nieva,
a priest of great virtue and very able&#8212;which was tremendously important there&#8212;and one who best mastered that language, as
well as that of the Indians in which he had had experience; and he worked in both of them, and wrote much to the great advantage
of those who came after him.&#8221;<a id="d0e1246src" href="#d0e1246" class="noteref">114</a> It is surprising that no previous writer has emphasized the presence of Domingo de Nieva, whose proficiency in Tagalog we
have already noted, at San Gabriel during the years when the printing of the Doctrinas must have been planned and executed.
His works are cited by Fern&aacute;ndez,<a id="d0e1249src" href="#d0e1249" class="noteref">115</a> and after giving a summary of his career, Aduarte added:


<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1267"></a>
[35]
</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e1269">&#8220;He wrote much in the language of the Indians and other things in the language of the Chinese for whom he had printed in their
language and characters a memorial upon the Christian life, with other brief tracts of prayer and meditation, in preparation
for the holy sacraments, of confession and the sacred communion. He was an enemy of sloth, and so worked much in Chinese,
in which he wrote a practically new grammar of the Chinese language, a vocabulary, a manual of confession and many sermons,
in order that those who had to learn this language might find it less difficult.&#8221;<a id="d0e1271src" href="#d0e1271" class="noteref">116</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e1274">Medina<a id="d0e1276src" href="#d0e1276" class="noteref">117</a> records these various works as Manila imprints of unknown date, and to this indefinite information about them we can add
nothing positive. However, it is apparent that some time before 1606, when Nieva died on his way to Mexico, he had had books
printed, and since they were in Chinese they must have been printed from wood-blocks, for at that early date it would have
been impossible to have cast the number of characters necessary to print in Chinese with movable type.

</p>
<p id="d0e1279">With Nieva was Maldonado, or San Pedro Martyr. He had been one of the first associates of Benavides in the first Chinese mission
at Baybay, but after the arrival of Cobo he had been sent by order of the first chapter to Pangasinan. When Cobo was appointed
acting provincial San Pedro Martyr was again assigned to the Chinese ministry. He had learned Tagalog, and after his return
to the Pari&aacute;n &#8220;he learned more words of the Chinese language than any other member of the order, though he was not successful
with the pronunciation.&#8221;<a id="d0e1281src" href="#d0e1281" class="noteref">118</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e1284">On May 31, 1592, the Governor received a letter from the Emperor of Japan demanding that an ambassador be sent to offer him
the fealty of the Philippines. Juan Cobo, as the best speaker of Chinese, was chosen to represent the Spaniards, and he left
Manila on July 29, 1592. After successfully convincing the Japanese Emperor of the amity of the Spaniards, he left to come
back to Manila, but his ship was wrecked in November on the coast of Formosa, and there Cobo was killed by hostile natives.
Meanwhile Benavides had gone back to Spain with Bishop Salazar in <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1286"></a>
[36]
</span>1591, and did not return to the Philippines until after his appointment as Bishop of Nueva Segovia in 1595.

</p>
<p id="d0e1288">That left as the only two remaining experts in the Chinese language, Domingo de Nieva and Juan de San Pedro Martyr, both of
whom were at San Gabriel in 1592. <i>Moreover, both of them knew Chinese and Tagalog.</i> A text in Tagalog was available, based on the Talavera-Plasencia-Oliver model, which had circulated freely, and this, we
believe, was further edited&#8212;hence the &#8220;corrected by the religious of the orders&#8221;&#8212;by these two Dominicans. In their editorial
work they may have been helped by Juan de la Cruz, who, we have noted, was sent to Bataan in 1588, there learned Tagalog,
and &#8220;succeeded so perfectly with it that Father Fr. Francisco San Joseph, who was afterwards the best linguist there, profited
by the papers and labors of P. Fr. Juan de la Cruz.&#8221;<a id="d0e1293src" href="#d0e1293" class="noteref">119</a> Juan de Oliver, the pioneer Franciscan Tagalist was still living and available for consultation, and the polylingual Jesuit,
Francisco Almerique, also was in Manila at the time. A Chinese text had been written by Juan Cobo, and both Nieva and San
Pedro Martyr were capable of preparing this for publication, again possibly aided by Almerique, and also Diego Mu&ntilde;oz, if as
an Augustinian he had been willing to cooperate with the Dominicans. Nothing remained to be done but have the blocks cut and
the impressions pulled.

</p>
<p class="div2"><a id="d0e1296"></a></p>
<h2>The Printing of the Books</h2>
<p id="d0e1299">The stage was set for the production of the Doctrinas. That there were Chinese xylographic models upon which the books could
be based is evidenced by the account of Mendoza of the considerable number of Chinese books brought to Manila by Martin de
Rada as early as 1575. A more likely model was a bilingual text in Spanish and Chinese which Cobo describes in his letter
of July 13, 1589, where speaking of the Jesuits in China he says:


<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1301"></a>
[37]
</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e1303">&#8220;Moreover the Father of the Company who was in China wrote and printed in Chinese letters a whole book of the unity of God,
the creation of the world, and the commandments explained; and in this book has gotten as far as the incarnation of the Son
of God. Concerning this I am not speaking of things heard, for I have it, and am thus certain of it, as of all the things
that happened. How far I have progressed with the Chinese letters I shall say later. This book was printed in China in 1584.
It circulates freely in China whence we have our copy, and because of the writing, contrary to what others have misleadingly
said about the Chinese, they have done him no ill: from which it may be inferred that the lion is not so wild as they paint
him.&#8221;<a id="d0e1305src" href="#d0e1305" class="noteref">120</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e1308">There is no direct evidence to support our belief that it was during the brief period after Castro returned, probably late
in 1590, and relieved Cobo of his executive responsibilities, and June 1592 when he left for Japan, that Cobo began intensive
plans for the production of bilingual texts. His recorded interest in such books, his influence with the Chinese, his energy
and his own linguistic aptitude would naturally have stimulated him to undertake the task. Whether he actually began work
on the blocks from which the books were printed, or merely suggested the feasibility of the idea, we do not know, but we feel
sure that Juan Cobo was the father of the production of books in the Philippines.

</p>
<p id="d0e1310">There is no need here to go into the history of printing in China; the method used there and its antiquity have been fully
described by others.<a id="d0e1312src" href="#d0e1312" class="noteref">121</a> That there were Chinese in Manila who understood this age-old process would seem obvious from the reports of skilled craftsmen
whose presence was noted by all the writers of the period. We have already quoted a reference to Juan Cobo&#8217;s teaching them
European trades, and Salazar in his already cited letter speaks of them further:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e1325">&#8220;They are so skillful and clever, that, as soon as they see any object made by a Spanish workman, they reproduce it with exactness.
What arouses my wonder most is, that when I arrived no Sangley knew how to paint anything; but now they have so perfected
themselves in this art that they have produced marvelous works with both the brush and the chisel.... What has pleased all
of us here has been the arrival of a bookbinder from Mexico. He brought books with him, set up a bindery, and hired a Sangley
who had offered his services to him. The Sangley secretly, and <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1327"></a>
[38]
</span>without his master noticing it, watched how the latter bound books, and lo, in less than [lacuna in MS.] he left the house,
saying that he wished to serve him no longer, and set up a similar shop.&#8221;<a id="d0e1329src" href="#d0e1329" class="noteref">122</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e1332">To turn over a manuscript copy of a book to a Chinaman who had already some familiarity with the production of books in China,
or who with a given text could carve the blocks according to tradition, was then not a matter of great difficulty. There were
Chinese books which showed what the result would be; there were Spanish books, definitely some from Mexico, which provided
samples of European characters and format.

</p>
<p id="d0e1334">Who cut the blocks&#8212;that is exactly what Chinaman&#8212;we do not know, nor do we know who handled the presswork, but it is logical
to assume that the whole process took place under the supervision of the fathers of San Gabriel, Juan Cobo if work had begun
before 1592, and certainly Nieva and San Pedro Martyr. One further aide may have been the lay brother, Pedro Rodriguez, who
had been sent to San Gabriel with Nieva, and who was a handyman or skilled mechanic, for Aduarte credits him with rebuilding
and restoring the hospital.

</p>
<p id="d0e1336">In speaking of the book printed for Blancas de San Jos&eacute;, Aduarte said that the printing had been done by &#8220;a Chinaman, a good
Christian,&#8221;<a id="d0e1338src" href="#d0e1338" class="noteref">123</a> but in this particular account he does not give the Chinaman&#8217;s name. Yet, where he describes the founding of a second church
of San Gabriel in Binondo, sometime after March 28, 1594<a id="d0e1341src" href="#d0e1341" class="noteref">124</a> and before June 15, 1596 when it was admitted to the chapter, he tells in some detail of printing done by Juan de Vera.<a id="d0e1347src" href="#d0e1347" class="noteref">125</a>


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e1351">&#8220;There have been in this town [Binondo, then called Minondoc] many Chinese of very exemplary lives. Juan de Vera was not only
a very devout man, and one much given to prayer, but a man who caused all his household to be the same. He always heard mass,
and was very regular in his attendance at church. He adorned the church most handsomely with hangings and paintings, because
he understood this art. He also, thinking only of the great results to be attained by means of holy and devout books, gave
himself to the great labor necessary to establish printing in this country, where there was no journeyman who could show him
the way, or give him an <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1353"></a>
[39]
</span>account of the manner of printing in Europe, which is very different from the manner of printing followed in his own country
of China. The Lord aided his pious intentions, and he gave to this undertaking not only continued and excessive labor, but
all the forces of his mind, which were great. In spite of the difficulties, he attained that which he desired, and was the
first printer in these islands; and this not from avarice&#8212;for he gained much more in his business as a merchant, and readily
gave up his profit&#8212;but merely to do service to the Lord and this good to the souls of the natives.&#8221;<a id="d0e1355src" href="#d0e1355" class="noteref">126</a></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p id="d0e1358">It is interesting to note that this narrative, which is in substance similar to that about the books of Blancas de San Jos&eacute;,
nowhere mentions the name of the priest in connection with Vera. It is probable that Juan de Vera was, as Retana believed,
the first typographer, and it may be that he also printed the Doctrinas of 1593. It is impossible to say with certainty, but
it is not too fanciful to suppose that Juan de Vera tried xylographic printing under the supervision of Nieva and San Pedro
Martyr, and after some experimenting achieved typography in the time of Blancas de San Jos&eacute;.

<p id="d0e1360">Since we have here dealt with a volume printed entirely from wood-blocks it does not seem necessary to discuss in detail the
subsequent typographical books. However, just as this goes to press, a copy of the <i>Ordinationes Generales prouintiae Sanctissimi Rosarij Philippinarum</i>,<a id="d0e1365src" href="#d0e1365" class="noteref">127</a> printed at Binondo by Juan de Vera in 1604, has been discovered, and also presented by Mr. Rosenwald to the Library of Congress.
This is the volume described by Remesal<a id="d0e1377src" href="#d0e1377" class="noteref">128</a> as being printed &#8220;in as fine characters and as correctly as if in Rome or Lyon.&#8221; No copy of the book had been described since
his day, although Medina<a id="d0e1380src" href="#d0e1380" class="noteref">129</a> and Retana<a id="d0e1386src" href="#d0e1386" class="noteref">130</a> both listed it from references which probably derived from Remesal. Its discovery&#8212;almost unbelievable coming so close on
the heels of that of the Doctrina&#8212;helps to close the gap between the latter and the two Bataan imprints<a id="d0e1392src" href="#d0e1392" class="noteref">131</a> of 1610, the <i>Arte y Reglas de la Lengva Tagala</i> and the <i>Librong Pagaaralan nang manga Tagalog nang uicang Castilla</i>.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1404"></a>
[40]
</span></p>
<p id="d0e1405">The full story of the early typographical products of the Philippines must wait upon another occasion, for the questions posed
by the scanty records and the handful of surviving books are extremely knotty. Where did the type come from? Medina suggested
it was imported from Macao; Retana believed it to have been cut in the Philippines. Fern&aacute;ndez said that the first works of
Blancas de San Jos&eacute; were printed at Bataan and the two 1610 books have that place of printing, yet in 1604 the <i>Ordinationes</i> issued from Binondo. Remesal wrote that this book was printed by Francisco de Vera, and the book itself bears the name of
Juan. Indeed, the history of the early typographers and the output of their presses, as it has so far been written, presents
many problems, but they are problems which we feel are outside the scope of this study.

</p>
<p id="d0e1410">To summarize what we have learned of the earliest printing in the Philippines: we have the possibility, but not a likely one,
that an <i>Arte</i> by Juan de Qui&ntilde;ones was printed xylographically in 1581; we know that in the first half of the year 1593 two Doctrinas were
printed xylographically&#8212;although we have no way of telling which came first&#8212;one in Tagalog from the Talavera-Plasencia-Oliver
text, and one in Chinese written by Juan Cobo, both edited and printed under the supervision of Domingo de Nieva and Juan
de San Pedro Martyr; we surmise that between 1593 and 1602 other works were also printed xylographically, such as the small
tracts of Juan de Villanueva and some of the books of Blancas de San Jos&eacute;, Nieva and others; and in 1602 was printed by Juan
de Vera, in all likelihood from movable type, the book of Our Lady of the Rosary by Blancas de San Jos&eacute;. The known facts are
not many, and we can only hope that time and further research will discover new ones to make the history of the earliest Philippine
imprints more complete and more satisfactory.

grammar is Frank R. Blake&#8217;s <i>A Grammar of the Tagalog Language</i>, New Haven, 1925, where, p. 1, he defines the language as follows: &#8220;Tag&aacute;log is the principal language of Luzon, the largest
island of the Philippine Archipelago. It is spoken in Manila and in the middle region of Luzon. Tag&aacute;log, like all the Philippine

had come with Felipe de Salcedo.&#8221; Salcedo had come back to Ceb&uacute; in 1566. Francisco Moreno, <i>Historia de la Santa Iglesia Metropolitana de Filipinas hasta 1650</i>, Manila, 1877, p. 226, states that Villanueva came in 1566, and died shortly after 1569. San Antonio, I, p. 173, writes,

of subjects. Robert Streit, <i>Bibliotheca Missionum</i>, Aachen, 1928, IV, pp. 327&#8211;31, cites a MS. account of it by the Jesuit father Sanchez who was present; and Valent&iacute;n Mar&iacute;n,

to Europe to obtain the necessary permission from lay and ecclesiastical authorities. The Jesuit Alonso Sanchez, who had been
sent to Spain to explain the situation in the Philippines, was at court, and told the King and Council of the Indies&#8212;quite
subverting his mission&#8212;that there was no need for more priests and particularly no need for a new order there. Chris&oacute;stomo
was discouraged, but the scheme was revivified by Juan de Castro who finally secured a letter from Philip&nbsp;II on September
20, 1585 endorsing the plan. Twenty-two volunteers sailed from Spain on July 17, 1586. In Mexico the Dominicans again found
Sanchez propagandizing against the mission and also encountered the efforts of the Viceroy to persuade the friars to remain
there. Notwithstanding, twenty friars subscribed to a set of ordinances at the Convent of Santo Domingo in Mexico on December
17, 1586. Of the twenty, fifteen went to the Philippines, three went directly to China, and Juan Chris&oacute;stomo, who was ill
and weak, and Juan Cobo, who had business there, stayed behind in Mexico.

If any distinction existed it was that a Sangley was a permanent resident of the Philippines&#8212;quite contrary to the derivation
of the word&#8212;or a Chinese of partially native blood. See San Agustin, p. 253.

exhibited at the St. Louis Fair of 1904 and illustrated in B. &amp; R., XXX, p. 228, he bought the land from Don Antonio Velada
on March 28, 1594, so that San Gabriel of Minondoc could not have been the place where the 1593 volumes were printed. Marin,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
